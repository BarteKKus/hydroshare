    <h2>Description of HydroShare Resource Types and Metadata Terms</h2>
    <h3>Generic Resource Type Description</h3>

    <h3> Time Series Resource Type Description</h3>
    <p>The time series is a sequence of individual data values that are ordered in time to record the
        changing trend of a certain phenomenon. As time series are widely used for hydrologic research
        and because they are also the primary granule of data sharing within the CUAHSI HIS,
        the time series will be an important resource type in the HydroShare system. Currently,
        we define a time series resource such that it can contain only one time series.
        To define the entities and attributes of a time series, we adopt the definition of a time series as
        specified by Version 2.0 of the Observations Data Model (ODM2) â€“ see description of a time series result in
        ODM2 <a href="https://github.com/UCHIC/ODM2/blob/master/doc/ODM2Docs/ext_results_timeseries.md">here</a>
    </p>
    <p> ODM2 does not limit the types of time series that can be supported.  Any time series supported by the
        ODM2 information model will be valid for input as a time series resource in HydroShare. The specific
        implementation of ODM2 that will be used for storing time series in HydroShare is described in more detail
        in a subsequent section, but, in general, ODM2 describes a time series via the following entities:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Site/SamplingFeature:</strong> The location at which the time series was observed or generated</li>
            <li><strong>Person/Organization:</strong> The person and organization responsible for creating the time series</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> The procedure used to create the time series</li>
            <li><strong>Variable/Units:</strong> The phenomenon that the time series represents and the units in which the values are recorded</li>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> The specific action or event that created the time series</li>
            <li><strong>ProcessingLevel:</strong> level of processing or quality control to which the time series has been subjected</li>
            <li><strong>Offset:</strong> The X, Y, and Z location of the time series measurements if offset from the site location</li>
            <li><strong>DataValues:</strong> The data values, their recorded dates/times,  and their value-level attributes</li>
        </ul>
