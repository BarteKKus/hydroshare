 u'This dataset has been used for ground truth validation of the snow inspector software (http://apps.hydroshare.org/apps/snow-inspector).\r\nOn two days, May 2 and May 9, 2015, 36 areas in the Yellowstone National Park area were visited. The snow inspector software was used to identify the MODIS satellite pixel boundaries at a 1:10,000 scale . For each location we identified between 1 and 8 pixels and estimated the percentage of snow-covered area on the ground. We selected locations with open ground, partially tree-covered ground, and ice-covered lakes. The total number of ground validation pixels was: 102 pixels on May 2, 2015, and 82 pixels on May 9, 2015 (total 184 pixels). Out of the total 184 pixels, Twenty-eight pixels were inspected both on May 2 and on May 9. The attached csv file has the following fields: Location (name of the location), PIXEL_X and PIXEL_Y (satellite pixel identifier), PIXEL, pixel number at the location, X1.May (satellite snow cover percentage on 1st May 2015), X2.May (satellite snow cover percentage on 2nd May 2015), MillerLo (low -bound estimate of snow cover percentage from ground observation), MillerHi (high estimate of snow cover percentage from ground observation), Landcover (type of land cover), Latitude, Longitude (latitude and longitude are in WGS 1984 in decimal degrees).title is Yellowstone Ground Snow Cover Validation. creator is Kadlec, Jiri. creator is Miller, Wood. author is Kadlec, Jiri. creator is Kadlec, Jiri. creator is Miller, Wood. subject is snow. subject is Yellowstone. subject is MODIS. organization is Brignam Young University. availability is public. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Kadlec, Jiri.

 u'RHESSys version 5.18.2 model for Ellerbe Creek at Club Blvd, in Durham, NC (West Ellerbe Creek; WEC hereafter).  WEC  is a headwater watershed composed of urbanized land cover (36% impervious area) in Durham, North Carolina.  The WEC is an order of magnitude larger with a drainage area of 15-km2.  Continuous streamflow stage and discharge data are available from the USGS (gage ID 0208675010).  Soils in the watershed range from sandy loam to silt loam (near riparian areas) and are characterized as being moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained (near riparian areas).  Located in the Piedmont physiographic province, Ellerbe Creek flows into Falls Lake, a water supply reservoir for Raleigh, NC.\r\n\r\nThis RHESSys model was developed using 30-m terrain, land cover, and soils  data from the U.S. national spatial data infrastructure (e.g. National Elevation Dataset and National Land Cover Dataset, USDA SSURGO soils data) acquired via web services using EcohydroLib (https://github.com/selimnairb/EcohydroLib), which was also used to assemble all required input datasets.  RHESSysWorkflows (https://github.com/selimnairb/RHESSysWorkflows) was used to create RHESSys-specific input files (e.g. world file, flow table, and soil and vegetation parameters).   See metadata.txt for more detailed workflow metadata, including command history, as well as data provenance information.\r\n\r\nDatasets:\r\n\r\nStreamflow gage location: National Hydrography Dataset Plus version 2 served by EcohydroLib (gage ID  0208675010)\r\nDigital Elevation Model (DEM): National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1/3 arc second served by GeoBrain WCS4DEM\r\nLandcover: National Landcover Dataset NLCD (2006) served by ORNL DAAC WCS\r\nSurface soil texture: USDA SSURGO data served by U.S. Department of Agriculture WFS and SOAP tabular web services\r\nVegetation leaf area index (LAI): Minimum LAI, peak LAI, and phenology derived from MODIS MOD 15 LAI and applied to biome types derived from landcover. \r\nClimate data (temperature, precipitation): North Durham Water Reclamation Facility Econet station (DURH) served by N.C.

 u'RHESSys version 5.18.2 model for Dead Run 5 watershed (DR5) in Baltimore County, near Catonsville, MD.  DR5 is a Piedmont headwater watershed composed of 1.5-km2 of urbanized land (40% impervious area) developed before contemporary stormwater regulations were enacted.  Soils in the DR5 watershed are mostly silt loam and are characterized as being well drained to poorly drained (i.e. riparian areas).  The study watershed lies within the greater Dead Run watershed, which is a 14-km2 sub-watershed of the 171.5-km2 Gwynns Falls watershed, draining into the Chesapeake Bay at Baltimore Harbor.  Gwynns Falls serves as a main study site of the BES LTER.  Continuous streamflow stage and discharge data for DR5 are available from a U.S. Geological Survey stream gauge (USGS gage ID 01589312).\r\n\r\nThis RHESSys model was developed using high-resolution local datasets provided by the NSF-funded Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research Site (BES LTER).  EcohydroLib (https://github.com/selimnairb/EcohydroLib) was used to assemble input datasets (see below) . RHESSysWorkflows (https://github.com/selimnairb/RHESSysWorkflows) was used to create RHESSys input files (e.g. world file, flow table, and soil and vegetation parameters).

 u'Bear Lake provides a unique location to use bathymetric data to analyze the relationship between changing water surface elevations and the accessible spawning habitat for fish species. The spawning habitat for the prey species of Bear Lake consists of cobble which is present in the littoral zone of the lake. The littoral zone is classified as the area of the water column that has light penetration, sufficient for macrophytes to photosynthesis, to reach the sediment floor of the lake. The analysis was performed using ESRI\u2019s ArcMap and Python coding  to calculate, automate, and illustrate this relationship; and to provide a possible methodology for water and wildlife management to apply to their unique situations to make informed decisions in the future. This method is advantageous when analyzing present or future conditions because of its versatility to create hypothetical scenarios.title is GIS in Water Resources Term Project 2015. creator is Meier, Matthew. author is Meier, Matthew. creator is Meier, Matthew. subject is GISWR2015. availability is public. format is application/pdf. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Meier, Matthew.

 u'RHESSys version 5.18.2 model for Watershed 14 of the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory LTER near Franklin, NC.  Watershed 14 is a 0.6-km2 forested headwater catchment that serves as a forested reference catchment, and has been undisturbed since 1927.   For more information, see the Coweeta Basin History Map (https://coweeta.uga.edu/sitehistory/basin).\r\n\r\nThis RHESSys model was developed using 10-m digital elevation model and vegetation density (i.e. leaf area index) provided by  the NSF- and USFS-funded Coweeta Long-term Ecological Research Site and Experimental Forest.  Soils data were acquired from USDA SSURGO web services using EcohydroLib (https://github.com/selimnairb/EcohydroLib),  which was also used to assemble all required input datasets.  RHESSysWorkflows (https://github.com/selimnairb/RHESSysWorkflows) was used to create RHESSys-specific input files (e.g. world file, flow table, and soil and vegetation parameters).   See metadata.txt for more detailed workflow metadata, including command history, as well as data provenance information.\r\n\r\nDatasets:\r\n\r\nStreamflow gage location: Coweeta LTER\r\nDigital Elevation Model (DEM): Custom DEM from Coweeta LTER LIDAR\r\nLandcover: Custom landcover from Coweeta LTER data\r\nSurface soil texture: USDA SSURGO data served by U.S. Department of Agriculture WFS and SOAP tabular web services\r\nVegetation leaf area index (LAI): Minimum LAI, peak LAI, and phenology derived from MODIS MOD 15 LAI and applied to biome types derived from landcover. \r\nClimate data (temperature, precipitation): Coweeta LTER data served by CLIMDB/HYDRODB8.

 u'Can your desktop computer crunch the large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in hydrology and across the sciences? Do you have access to, or the know how to, take advantage of advanced high performance computing (HPC) capability? Web based cyberinfrastructure takes work off your desk or laptop computer and onto infrastructure or "cloud" based data and processing servers. This talk will describe the HydroShare collaborative environment and web based services being developed to support the sharing and processing of hydrologic data and models. HydroShare is expanding the data sharing capability of the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System by broadening the classes of data accommodated to include geospatial data used in hydrology. HydroShare will also include new capability to share models and model components, and will take advantage of emerging social media functionality to enhance information about and collaboration around hydrologic data and models. The HydroShare web interface and social media functions are being developed using the Django web application framework. The integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) is being used to manage federated data content.

 u'Can your desktop computer crunch the large GIS datasets that are becoming increasingly common across the geosciences?  Do you have access to, or the know how to, take advantage of advanced high performance computing (HPC) capability?  Web based cyberinfrastructure takes work off your desk or laptop computer and onto infrastructure or "cloud" based data and processing servers.  This talk will describe the HydroShare collaborative environment and web based services being developed to support the sharing and processing of hydrologic data and models.  HydroShare supports the storage and sharing of a broad class of hydrologic data including time series, geographic features and rasters, multidimensional space-time data and structured collections of data representing river geometry.  Web service tools and a python client library provide researchers with access to high performance computing resources without requiring them to become HPC experts.  This reduces the time and effort spent in finding and organizing the data required to prepare the inputs for hydrologic models and facilitates the management of online data and execution of models on HPC systems.  This talk will illustrate web and client based use of data services that support the delineation of watersheds to define a modeling domain, then extract terrain and land use information to automatically configure the inputs required for hydrologic models.  These services support the Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Model (TauDEM) tools for watershed delineation and generation of hydrology-based terrain information such as wetness index and stream networks.  These services also support the derivation of inputs for the Utah Energy Balance snowmelt model used to address questions such as how climate, land cover and land use change may affect snowmelt inputs to runoff generation.  These cases serve as examples for how this approach can be extended to other models to enhance the use of web and data services in the geosciences.\r\n\r\nPresentation at Kansas University GIS Days November 18, 2015title is Clearing your Desk!

 u'This data provides an illustration of the height above the nearest stream approach to flood inundation mapping based on the TauDEM vertical distance to stream function.  This example uses a 10 m resolution National Elevation dataset for Onion Creek in Texas.   Height above the nearest stream may be thought of as a \u201crelative elevation function\u201d which measures for every DEM cell in the landscape the difference in elevation between that cell and the cell to which it flows on the stream channel.  This is like a \u201cwater depth\u201d or \u201cstage height\u201d function defined using  terrain analysis continuously across the landscape.  This relative elevation function, combined with a depth in each stream reach provide a simplified terrain based approach to flood inundation mapping premised on the following:\r\n\r\n1.  Each reach has a water depth hw, from a hydraulic model such as SPRNT or RAPID.\r\n2.  Each reach has an ID\r\n3.  Each grid cell has the ID of the reach it connects to (catchment grid) and the height above the stream hs\r\n4.  Flood extent is \u201crapidly\u201d mapped as \r\nIf(hw(id) > hs(id))\r\n   Inundation depth = hw(id) - hs(id)\r\nElse\r\n   Inundation depth = 0\r\n\r\nThe data here can also be used to compute reach averaged hydraulic properties as follows\r\n1.  For each reach the stream network file gives reach length L.\r\n2.  For a series of water depths using the height above nearest stream intersected with catchment raster the innundation water volume V, surface area As and bed area Ab are obtained.\r\n3.  Reach average properties are then computed as\r\nCross section Area A = V/L\r\nWetted perimeter P = Ab/L\r\nTop width = As/L\r\nHydraulic Radius = A/P\r\n\r\nThis approach is a simplification over finer scale hydraulics, and the inaccuracy due to introduction of this simplification still needs evaluation.  This approach is also dependent on how well the DEM represents the channel and flooded area.  This is expected to improve as we get better LIDAR DEMs and develop better ways to hydrologically condition DEMs that do not involve pit filling.title is Example of Height above Stream Flood Inundation Mapping Approach. creator is Tarboton, David. author is Tarboton, David. creator is Tarboton, David. subject is DEM. subject is NFIE. subject is HAND. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. coverage_type is box. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. format is application/zip. format is application/mxd. format is image/tiff. format is text/plain. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Tarboton, David.

 u'HydroShare is an online, collaborative system for open sharing of hydrologic data, analytical tools, and models. It supports the sharing of and collaboration around \u201cresources\u201d which are defined primarily by standardized metadata, content data models for each resource type, and an overarching resource data model based on the Open Archives Initiative\u2019s Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) standard and a hierarchical file packaging system called \u201cBagIt\u201d. HydroShare expands the data sharing capability of the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System by broadening the classes of data accommodated to include geospatial and multidimensional space-time datasets commonly used in hydrology. HydroShare also includes new capability for sharing models, model components, and analytical tools and will take advantage of emerging social media functionality to enhance information about and collaboration around hydrologic data and models. It also supports web services and server/cloud based computation operating on resources for the execution of hydrologic models and analysis and visualization of hydrologic data. HydroShare uses iRODS as a network file system for underlying storage of datasets and models. Collaboration is enabled by casting datasets and models as "social objects". Social functions include both private and public sharing, formation of collaborative groups of users, and value-added annotation of shared datasets and models. The HydroShare web interface and social media functions were developed using the Django web application framework coupled to iRODS. Data visualization and analysis is supported through the Tethys Platform web GIS software stack. Links to external systems are supported by RESTful web service interfaces to HydroShare\u2019s content. This presentation will introduce the HydroShare functionality developed to date and describe ongoing development of functionality to support collaboration and integration of data and models.    \r\n\r\nSlides for AGU 2015 presentation H42A-04, December 17, 2015\r\ntitle is HydroShare: Advancing Hydrology through Collaborative Data and Model Sharing. creator is Tarboton, David. author is Tarboton, David. creator is Tarboton, David. subject is AGU2015. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Tarboton, David.

 u'Anticipated changes to climate, human population, land use, and urban form will alter the hydrology and availability of water within the water systems on which the world\u2019s population relies.  Understanding the effects of these changes will be paramount in sustainably managing water resources, as well as maintaining associated capacity to provide ecosystem services (e.g., regulating flooding, maintaining instream flow during dry periods, cycling nutrients, and maintaining water quality). It will require better information characterizing both natural and human mediated hydrologic systems and enhanced ability to generate, manage, store, analyze, and share growing volumes of observational data. Over the past several years, a number of hydrology domain cyberinfrastructures have emerged or are currently under development that are focused on providing integrated access to and analysis of data for cross-domain synthesis studies. These include the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information System (HIS), the Critical Zone Observatory Information System (CZOData), HydroShare, the BiG CZ software system, and others. These systems have focused on sharing, integrating, and analyzing hydrologic observations data. This presentation will describe commonalities and differences in the cyberinfrastructure approaches used by these projects and will highlight successes and lessons learned in addressing the challenges of big and complex data. It will also identify new challenges and opportunities for next generation cyberinfrastructure and a next generation of cyber-savvy scientists and engineers as developers and users.title is Hydrology Domain Cyberinfrastructures:   Successes, Challenges, and Opportunities. creator is Horsburgh, Jeff. author is Horsburgh, Jeff. creator is Horsburgh, Jeff. subject is AGU 2015. subject is HydroShare. subject is Cyberinfrastructure. subject is Hydrology. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Horsburgh, Jeffery.

 u'Can your desktop computer crunch the large GIS datasets that are becoming increasingly common across the geosciences? Do you have access to or the know-how to take advantage of advanced high performance computing (HPC) capability? Web based cyberinfrastructure takes work off your desk or laptop computer and onto infrastructure or "cloud" based data and processing servers. This talk will describe the HydroShare collaborative environment and web based services being developed to support the sharing and processing of hydrologic data and models. HydroShare supports the upload, storage, and sharing of a broad class of hydrologic data including time series, geographic features and raster datasets, multidimensional space-time data, and other structured collections of data. Web service tools and a Python client library provide researchers with access to HPC resources without requiring them to become HPC experts. This reduces the time and effort spent in finding and organizing the data required to prepare the inputs for hydrologic models and facilitates the management of online data and execution of models on HPC systems. This presentation will illustrate the use of web based data and computation services from both the browser and desktop client software. These web-based services implement the Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Model (TauDEM) tools for watershed delineation, generation of hydrology-based terrain information, and preparation of hydrologic model inputs. They allow users to develop scripts on their desktop computer that call analytical functions that are executed completely in the cloud, on HPC resources using input datasets stored in the cloud, without installing specialized software, learning how to use HPC, or transferring large datasets back to the user\'s desktop. These cases serve as examples for how this approach can be extended to other models to enhance the use of web and data services in the geosciences. \r\n\r\nSlides for AGU 2015 presentation IN51C-03, December 18, 2015title is Clearing your Desk!

 u'Geospatial data are present everywhere today with the proliferation of location-aware computing devices and sensors. This is especially true in the scientific community where large amounts of data are driving research and education activities in many domains. Collaboration over geospatial data, for example, in modeling, data analysis and visualization, must still overcome the barriers of specialized software and expertise among other challenges. The GABBs project aims at enabling broader access to geospatial data exploration and computation by developing spatial data infrastructure building blocks that leverage capabilities of end-to-end application service and virtualized computing framework in HUBzero. Funded by NSF Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBS) initiative, GABBs provides a geospatial data architecture that integrates spatial data management, mapping and visualization and will make it available as open source. The outcome of the project will enable users to rapidly create tools and share geospatial data and tools on the web for interactive exploration of data without requiring significant software development skills, GIS expertise or IT administrative privileges. This presentation will describe the development of geospatial data infrastructure building blocks and the scientific use cases that help drive the software development, as well as seek feedback from the user communities.title is Geospatial-enabled Data Exploration and Computation through  Data Infrastructure Building Blocks. creator is Song, Carol. author is Song, Carol. creator is Song, Carol. contributor is Zhao, Lan. contributor is Venkatesh Merwade. subject is HUBzero. subject is Geospatial data. subject is GABBS. organization is Purdue University. availability is private. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Song, Carol.

 u'This report describes the Bertrand Creek update of the surface water quantity hydrologic model, TOPNET, which was originally developed as part of the WRIA1 Watershed Management Project.  The model update has increased the spatial discretization of model elements, which has resulted in an improved representation of the spatial variability of precipitation, as well as land use and soil based parameters in both the U.S. and Canadian portions of the watershed.  After updating the hydrologic model, we conducted a new calibration to the observed streamflow measurements at Bertrand Creek watershed outlet at Rathbone Road, which began in 2003.  Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency statistics greater than E= 0.85 show that the updated model and calibration are a good representation of the hydrologic system, given the current drainage and groundwater pumping practices.    Using a historic climate record of 60 years, the water balance presented illustrates the mean monthly relationships between precipitation, baseflow, soil storage, surface runoff, and irrigation demand.  Exceedence probability flow results show that there is a low probability of sustaining both irrigation water use and instream flows without significant water management activities. The updated model developed in this work can be used to understand the potential effects of proposed management solutions with for scenario testing and sensitivity analysis in future work.title is Bertrand Creek Hydrologic Model Update and Assessment 2008;  Bertrand Creek Improvement Project Grant No. G0800436. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. contributor is Allen, Doug. contributor is Tarboton, David. contributor is Greenberg, Joanne. contributor is Anderson, Tom. contributor is Doremus, Llyn. contributor is Friemund, Jeremy. subject is hydrologic model. subject is water management. subject is Bertrand Creek. subject is WRIA1 Watershed Management Project. subject is instream flows. subject is MOSCEM. availability is public. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

SWE is calculated using the brightness temperature observations from the AMSR-E instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. The brightness temperature observations used to calculate SWE are made at frequencies of 18.7 and 36.5 GHz and are collected twice daily, once during the morning hours and once during the afternoon. The temperature brightness data is processed at NSIDC and projected on a 25 km EASE grid. SWE is calculated from only temperature brightness data collected during the morning to reduce the potential effects of wet snow in the afternoons.The data flags incorporated within this data set represent the percentage of missing data for a given basin. Occasionally the satellite swath does not completely cover the entire region of interest and misses some portion of the watershed. These missing values are represented in the missing data column. This column represents the total percentage of the missing pixels within the watershed. For example: missing data indicated as 1 represents 100% of pixels within the watershed are missing and the corresponding average SWE value is unknown.

 u"The Nooksack River Basin HydroShare Observatory is designed to be used by individual researchers or research or classroom  groups collaborating on hydrologic research in the transboundary Nooksack River Basin, State of Washington, USA and Province of British Columbia, Canada.   The goal is to increase data and model discovery, computing, and publication functions provided by HydroShare.  All resources available in this Collection are publicly available, and contributed by individual authors using HydroShare.   The intent of this observatory is to play a cumulative role in maximizing the scientific return on individual investments of contributors conducting research in the Nooksack. \r\n\r\nObservatories depend on collections of data and groups of people.  In HydroShare, the Nooksack Observatory is a resource type called a 'Collection', and we anticipate the addition of 'Groups' when that specific software functionality is completed (expected for 2016).  In short, a collection is an organization of HydroShare data, while a  group is an organization of HydroShare users  . Collections and Groups are designed to provide efficiency in research by enhancing individual capabilities to progress their research by sharing and using  information with the group, and may be organized by geography, discipline, or research topic.  If successful, this Observatory will help researchers  avoid  \u2018reinventing the wheel\u2019 and progressing individual and collaborative research studies using shared resources.  title is Nooksack River Basin Observatory. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. contributor is Beaulieu, Jezra. contributor is Murphy, Ryan. subject is Nooksack. subject is transboundary. subject is watershed. subject is hydrology. organization is University of Washington. availability is public. coverage_type is box. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/06c1c412dabc435f97415f9dac072fd0/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/99a170544d2741ac983a1f25b2f38451/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u"The Thunder Creek HydroShare Observatory is designed to be used by individual researchers or research or classroom groups collaborating on hydrologic research in the Thunder Creek, Skagit River Basin, State of Washington, USA. The goal is to increase data and model discovery, computing, and publication functions provided by HydroShare. All resources available in this Collection are publicly available, and contributed by individual authors using HydroShare. The intent of this observatory is to play a cumulative role in maximizing the scientific return on individual investments of contributors conducting research in the Thunder Creek drainage.\r\n\r\nObservatories depend on collections of data and groups of people. In HydroShare, the Nooksack Observatory is a resource type called a 'Collection', and we anticipate the addition of 'Groups' when that specific software functionality is completed (expected for 2016). In short, a collection is an organization of HydroShare data, while a group is an organization of HydroShare users . Collections and Groups are designed to provide efficiency in research by enhancing individual capabilities to progress their research by sharing and using information with the group, and may be organized by geography, discipline, or research topic. If successful, this Observatory will help researchers avoid \u2018reinventing the wheel\u2019 and progressing individual and collaborative research studies using shared resources.title is Thunder Creek  Observatory. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Strauch, Ronda. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Strauch, Ronda. subject is glacier. subject is landslides. subject is hydrology. subject is modeling. subject is DHSVM. subject is landlab. organization is University of Washington. organization is University of Washington. availability is public. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u'Generating estimates of daily reference photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR). We show the procedure to generate estimates of daily reference PAR using solar radiation data. The input for the R script (CalculateDailyPAR.R) is a raw time series of hourly solar radiation (stored in variable \u2018ws\u2019) that for our case was obtained from the CIMIS website (station id: 105) [California Department of Water Resources, 2015]. The script processes the data set to format the date and time columns, and to identify missing data points reporting their position within the time series (variable \u2018na.id\u2019). The user fills the gaps using adequate strategies and creates a new input file (stored in variable \u2018fill.points\u2019) containing the values to fill in within the time series. A reference PAR estimate is obtained as a constant fraction of solar radiation using the conversion factor proposed by [Meek et al., 1984]. The script then calculates an average daily value of solar radiation and integrates the reference PAR over the daytime period to obtain a daily value. The script ends by generating a final table (\u2018ws.results\u2019) reporting daily values of solar radiation (maximum and mean in W m-2), and maximum, mean, and minimum reference PAR values in units of (\u03bcmol m-2 d-1) and (mol m-2 d-1).\r\nDOI:10.6084/m9.figshare.3412765title is R script to calculate daily PAR from solar radiation data. creator is Villamizar, Sandra. author is Villamizar, Sandra. creator is Villamizar, Sandra. subject is R script. subject is Solar Radiation. subject is Photosynthetically Active Radiation. organization is Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Bucaramanga. availability is public. format is application/R. format is text/csv. format is text/plain. format is image/png. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/885906ef97e542a8a33048ea486ddfdf/. resource_type is Generic. owner is Villamizar, Sandra.

 u'By creating rating curves for suspended sediment concentrations at each station, we are able to compare sediment load along the north and south fork paths and see how discharge and sediment concentrations change from the winter to summer months.  We also performed a mass balance along the South Fork Path (Saxon Road \u2013 Cedarville \u2013 Ferndale) to try to understand where sediment is being degraded and deposited as it flows down river.  Looking at sediment transport upstream and downstream on the river will give us a better idea of how the river is impacted from the changing climate and base flows.\r\n\r\nThe North Fork of the Nooksack River experiences higher flows and higher turbidity in late summer and fall from August to September, while the south fork experiences the higher flows and higher turbidity from September to January which are nearly twice as high as those we see in the North Fork.  The mass balance shows that there is a large increase in sediment flux from Saxon Road to Cedarville and a decrease from Cedarville to Ferndale.  This indicates that there is a large contribution of sediment from the middle and North Forks of the river and that there must be some deposition of the sediment between Cedarville and Ferndale.  Both degradation and deposition, as well as lower flows have negative impacts on salmon redds which in turn impact the cities along the river and the Nooksack Indian Tribe.  title is UPLAND VS.

 u'We present the procedure to obtain daily averages of ancillary water data (e.g., turbidity and chlorophyll) that may be used to support the interpretation of the daily metabolic rate estimates. The Ancillary_DarilyAvg.R script needs to be executed as many times as the number of available ancillary water parameters (twice for our case). For the case of the SJR restoration reach, the data can be accessed by doing a query on the CDEC website indicating the sensor number (28 for chlorophyll, 27 for turbidity), the interval of the data (event or hourly), and the starting and ending dates of the period of interest. A comma separated value file is produced after the request, and each of these files will be the input to this R script.\r\nSection 1 of the script sets up the working directory; the ancillary water data input file is read in section 2 and particular configuration parameters are specified in section 3. According to these parameters, a new table (\u2018table1\u2019) with only the columns of interest is created in section 4; section 5 converts into NA\u2019s all the cell values that report missing data (\u201cm\u201d) or errors (\u201c-9998\u201d or \u201c-9997\u201d). The actual daily averages are calculated in section 6 and stored in the variable \u2018table4\u2019. Section 7 deals with the transformation of the date column to an actual date format in order to identify whether or not there are missing days within the time series. The output of this section (dates and intervals between dates) as well as the daily averages contained in \u2018table4\u2019, are merged into a new variable \u2018table5\u2019. Finally, section 8 prints the output of this script as a tab separated text file.\r\nDOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.3413023title is R script to obtain daily averages of ancillary water data (turbidity, specific conductivity, etc.). creator is Villamizar, Sandra. author is Villamizar, Sandra. creator is Villamizar, Sandra. subject is Water quality. subject is Time series. subject is Daily averages. organization is Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Bucaramanga. availability is public. format is text/plain. format is application/R. format is text/csv. format is image/png. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/885906ef97e542a8a33048ea486ddfdf/. resource_type is Generic. owner is Villamizar, Sandra.

To install Landlab, please follow the instructions @ https://landlab.github.io/#/#install\r\n\r\nThe starting point is to obtain a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in ESRI's Ascii Grid format, or convert it to this format. The format consists of a 6-line header followed by elevation values. Here we'll work with a small example DEM file 'west_bijou_gully.asc' (attached in this resource). The header for this file is as follows:\r\nncols        43\r\nnrows        89\r\nxllcorner    559705.000000000000\r\nyllcorner    4380220.000000000000\r\ncellsize     3\r\nNODATA_value 0\r\nHere, our objective is to translate the contents of this file into a Landlab RasterModelGrid.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial also illustrates setting boundary conditions on DEMs and using the halo option for reading in DEMs without nodata values around the edges.\r\nFor this we will use the resource 'synthetic_landsacpe.asc'.\r\n\r\nCiting Landlab:\r\nTucker, G.E., Gasparini, N.M., Istanbulluoglu, E., Hobley, D.E.J., Nudurupati, S.S., Adams, J.M., and Hutton, E.

 u'This example runs the \'landslide\' component of Landlab and is designed for undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning more about Landlab and landslide modeling.  Landlab is a Python-based landscape modeling environment and the landslide component is one of many components available for users to access and link together to build their own landscape model. For more information about Landlab, see http://landlab.github.io/#/.  Data needed for the example are spatial data on landscape characteristics for Thunder Creek watershed in North Cascade mountains of Washington.  They include soil, geology, vegetation, topography, and landform data that can be used for earth surface analyses such as landslides and hydrology.  Thus, the data can be used for more than this landslide example.  Elevation was acquired from STRM at 30 m grid scale;  the other datasets are matched to in scale and location.  Slope was derived from the elevation file and represents dimensionless "tan theta".  Specific contributing area represents the \'upstream\' area draining to each cell divided by the cell\'s width (so minimum value is 30 m).   Landform data was developed by Jon Riedel of National Park Service.  Landslides were extracted from these data as "mass wasting" events.  Land use and land cover (LULC) data were acquired from USGS National land Cover Data (NLCD) based on 2011 Landsat satellite data and grouped into eight general categories.  Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) provides the source of  lithology in its surface geology maps that displays rocks and deposits as geologic map units.  These were aggregated into eight classes based on similarities in origin and generally increasing strength by Dr. Riedel.  Cohesion represent root cohesion based on the LULC ; soils are assumed to be primarily cohesionless, lacking \u201ctrue cohesion\u201d because of their low clay content in this mountain terrain.   Soil depth comes from NRCS soil survey depth-to-restricted layer (weighted-average aggregation) within each soil map unit. Transmissivity was derived from the soil survey saturated hydraulic conductivity (depth averaged) multiplied by depth-to-restricted layer for each soil map unit. All soils within this watershed are sandy loam or loamy sand; therefore, soil surface texture was used as an indicator of internal angle of friction (phi).  A header file is also provided to understand the spatial details of the ASCII files and to facilitate capability with GIS.

 u'We describe the procedure for the consolidation of the daily metabolic rate estimates along with summary weather, reach and water derived data that may be used for the interpretation of the processes happening along the reach of interest. \r\nSections 1 and 2 of the R script define the working directory and read the file containing the time series of daily metabolic rate estimates for the study period (related variable: \xb4table1\xb4). Section 3 converts to NAs the daily metabolic rates that are of bad quality. The considerations to do this are first, daily metabolic rate estimates for days in which the available number of DO or temperature data points were less than 65% of the maximum daily total (this criterion may be modified by the user) and second, daily outputs that reflect failure on model performance due to either reaeration rates much higher than metabolic processes or DO concentrations increasing during night time (these resulted in positive values of the estimated CR24 and/or negative values of GPP).\r\nSection 4 reads the daily solar radiation and reference PAR estimates and together with the filtered metabolic rates conform the final results table (related variable: \xb4main1\xb4). Next, in section 5, the script reads the daily averages of ancillary water data (turbidity and chlorophyll for our case) and appends them to the final results table (related variable: \xb4main 4\xb4). In section 6 the script creates figures 2, 3, and 4 of the publication. Figure 2 presents stacked panels of time series of mean daily discharge, water temperature, and DO (daily maximum, minimum and range); figure 3 presents stacked panels of the daily metabolic estimates (GPP, CR24 and NDM) in the context of the flow dynamics of the reach; figure 4 presents the ancillary data that is expected to support the analysis of the daily metabolic rates within the reach (turbidity, chlorophyll and reference PAR). Finally, section 7 prints the final results table that contains all the daily variables for the period of analysis.\r\nDOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.3427892\r\ntitle is R script to produce final plots for the interpretation of the time series of daily metabolic estimates within a river reach. creator is Villamizar, Sandra. author is Villamizar, Sandra. creator is Villamizar, Sandra. subject is Time Series. subject is Whole-stream metabolism. subject is Interpretation of reach-estimates. subject is River ecohydrology. organization is Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Bucaramanga. availability is public. format is image/png. format is text/plain. format is application/R. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Villamizar, Sandra. extra is Takes data from source 3: https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/29c5ce6c1f3146538d252bc15ad5a976/. extra is Takes data from source 2: https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/5c2c3dbf13174147a5109b84c62a142b/. extra is Takes data from source 1: https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/aadd7dd60f31498590de32c9b14446c3/.

 u"How will you manage the data for your next big collaborative project?  HydroShare is an online, collaborative system for open sharing of hydrologic data, analytical tools, and models.  It supports the sharing of and collaboration around \u201chydrologic resources\u201d which are data, or models in formats commonly used in hydrology.  HydroShare expands the data sharing capability of the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System by broadening the classes of data accommodated to include geospatial and multidimensional space-time datasets commonly used in hydrology.  HydroShare also includes new capability for sharing models, model components, and analytical tools. It can help you manage your data among collaborators and meet funding agency data management plan requirements.  It can publish your data using citable digital object identifiers (DOIs).  In this seminar you will learn how to load files into HydroShare so that you can share them with colleagues and publish them.  I will show how to manage access to the content that you share, and how to easily add metadata, and in some cases how metadata is automatically completed for you.  The capability to assign DOIs to HydroShare resources means that they are permanently citable helping researchers who share their data get credit for the data published.  Models, and Model Instances, which in HydroShare are a model application to a specific site with its input and output data can also receive DOI's.  Collections allow multiple resources from a study to be aggregated together providing a comprehensive archival record of the research outcomes, supporting transparency and reproducibility, thereby enhancing trust in the research findings.  Reuse to support additional research is also enabled.  Files in HydroShare may be analyzed through web apps configured to access HydroShare resources.

 u'DHSVM was configured to cover the Upper and Lower Chehalis basins (Hydrologic Unit Codes, or HUCs 17100103 and 17100104). These do not include areas draining to the estuary downstream of Aberdeen.  The area extends into the Olympic National Forest to the North, the Willapa Hills to the South, and Onalaska to the East with  streamflow output corresponding to locations of interest draining 55 sub-basin areas.  In DHSVM, the watershed is subdivided into a uniform square grid of cells, or model elements, with spatial resolution generally ranging between 10 m and 150 m; for this study we use a resolution of 150 m. The spatial distribution of the soil and vegetation characteristics of the watershed are captured at the scale of the 150 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used as a primary input to DHSVM. As discussed below, some features of the stream network were difficult to resolve, even at this resolution, specifically due to (1) inconsistencies in the average downstream directions when elevations were averaged to a 150 m grid, and (2) the close vicinity of headwater gridcells at sub-watershed boundaries. Terrain analysis methods for digital streamflow network and watershed delineation (available in ArcGIS) were used to resolve the spatial distribution of elevation characteristics at the 150 m scale using flow pathways developed at the 30 m scale.title is Chehalis Basin DHSVM model instance 2016. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. contributor is Lettenmeier, Dennis. contributor is Cao, Qian. contributor is Lee, Se-yeun. contributor is Mauger, Guillaume. subject is DHSVM. subject is Chehalis. subject is Observatory. organization is University of Washington. availability is public. format is application/zip. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Instance Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u'How do you manage, track, and share hydrologic data and models within your research group? Do you find it difficult to keep track of who has access to which data and who has the most recent version of a dataset or research product? Do you sometimes find it difficult to share data and models and collaborate with colleagues outside your home institution? Would it be easier if you had a simple way to share and collaborate around hydrologic datasets and models?  HydroShare is a new, web-based system for sharing hydrologic data and models with specific functionality aimed at making collaboration easier. Within HydroShare, we have developed new functionality for creating datasets, describing them with metadata, and sharing them with collaborators. In HydroShare we cast hydrologic datasets and models as \u201csocial objects\u201d that can be published, collaborated around, annotated, discovered, and accessed. In this presentation, we will discuss and demonstrate the collaborative and social features of HydroShare and how it can enable new, collaborative workflows for you, your research group, and your collaborators across institutions. HydroShare\u2019s access control and sharing functionality enable both public and private sharing with individual users and collaborative user groups, giving you flexibility over who can access data and at what point in the research process. HydroShare can make it easier for collaborators to iterate on shared datasets and models, creating multiple versions along the way, and publishing them with a permanent landing page, metadata description, and citable Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Functionality for creating and sharing resources within collaborative groups can also make it easier to overcome barriers such as institutional firewalls that can make collaboration around large datasets difficult. Functionality for commenting on and rating resources supports community collaboration and quality evaluation of resources in HydroShare.\r\n\r\nThis presentation was delivered as part of a Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u'This report summarizes results from my first year\u2019s iUTAH fellowship (2012-13), which involved exploratory, qualitative research on local water management in the Wasatch Regional Metropolitan Area, specifically focusing on Cache Valley, Heber Valley, and the Red Butte Watershed of Salt Lake City, Utah. Data collection consisted of two types of activities: meeting observations and semi-structured interviews. I reviewed meeting notes and synthetic notes for prevailing themes, and distinguished between patterns that emerged both within and across the three study areas.\r\n\r\nThe structure of water management in the WRMA crosses macro-institutional, meso-watershed, and micro-individual scales. The focus of my research has been at the meso-scale, within which many local water management organizations (LWMOs) make critical decisions surrounding water quality and quantity. In this first phase of my work, I identify five types of key organization decisions made by LWMOs: operational, maintenance, water supply, infrastructure change, and enforcement. I then describe four types of linkages among WRMA water actors and provide examples of how these linkages impact LWMOs\u2019 decisions. I then describe and analyze the ways in which LWMOs are making adaptive decisions in the face of key changes in urbanization and water availability. Two common adaptive processes are: (a) improving infrastructure efficiency, and (b) engaging in organizational partnerships. The report concludes with directions for future research. The LWMO interview instrument is included in the appendix. \r\n\r\ntitle is Final Report: Armstrong 2013 Exploratory Interviews of Water Managers. creator is Armstrong, Andrea. author is Armstrong, Andrea. creator is Armstrong, Andrea. contributor is Jackson-smith, Douglas. subject is Cache Valley. subject is Heber Valley. subject is adaptation. subject is local water management organizations. subject is water management. subject is interview. subject is meeting observations. subject is iUTAH. availability is public. coverage_type is box. coverage_type is period. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Iutah Data manager. owner is Armstrong, Andrea.

 u'This dataset reports the nitrogen isotope composition of leaves from 11 common riparian plant species collected from streams across the three iUTAH watersheds in October 2013 and July-August 2014. In addition, algae and moss samples were collected at many of the same sites on the Salt Lake Valley streams in September 2014. See the attached abstract and methods for more details.\r\n\r\nLeaf samples were collected at 255 sites. Sites consisted of a ~ 30 m transect parallel to the stream, including both sides of the stream when possible. We sampled leaves from up to 11 species representative of the local flora when present (see spreadsheet for species names). Plants were only sampled if they were in close proximity (< 2 m) of the perennial channel or were visibly rooted in the stream. At each site, we collected 5 \u2013 15 leaves from each species, including a mixture of mature sun and shade leaves from all parts of the plant. Where multiple individuals of the same species were present at the same site, we sampled leaves from up to five individuals, which were then composited by species. We sampled Salt Lake Valley sites during late September / early October 2013, and Cache and Heber Valley sites in late July 2014.\r\n\r\nPlease approach the algae/moss carbon isotope data with caution as carbonates were not removed prior to analysis; however, samples were thoroughly rinsed in deionized water to remove associated sediment.title is Riparian plant, algae, and moss nitrogen and carbon isotopes across the iUTAH watersheds. creator is Hall, Steven. author is Hall, Steven. creator is Hall, Steven. contributor is Bowling, David. contributor is Baker, Michelle. contributor is Hale, Rebecca. contributor is Ehleringer, Jim. subject is Plant. subject is carbon. subject is nitrogen. subject is Riparian. subject is iUTAH. subject is land use. subject is Salt Lake Valley. subject is Algae. subject is Red Butte. subject is Moss. subject is water quality. subject is species. subject is Heber Valley. subject is Logan River. subject is 13C. subject is 15N. subject is Provo River. subject is Cache Valley. availability is public. coverage_type is box. format is application/pdf. format is text/csv. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Iutah Data manager. owner is Hall, Steven. extra is Observed Variables: Original sample ID (denotes ID in SIRFER database), Species name (factor variable), Site (factor variable), Sample type (factor variable), Stream/river name (factor variable), Land use category (factor variable), Watershed name (factor variable), Longitude, Latitude, 13C (per mil), Carbon content (%), 15N (per mil), Nitrogen content (%). extra is Variable Description: Site and stable isotope values. extra is Data Collection Method: Leaves were oven-dried at 70 C and ground to a fine powder with mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen, and analyzed for C and N isotope ratios and elemental content.

 u'This resource contains the results of an experiment to test the effects of nutrients and pharmaceuticals on stream biofilms at sites on three rivers in northern Utah: Logan River, Red Butte Creek, and Middle Provo River. We constructed contaminant exposure substrates (CES) by filling 1-oz plastic cups with agar amended with individual and combined additions of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, iron) and pharmaceuticals (caffeine, diphenhydramine).  The CSV file \u201cnutrients pharmaceuticals CES treatments\u201d lists the contaminant treatments included in the CES experiment.  We capped the agar with an inorganic (fritted glass disc) or organic (cellulose sponge) substrate to select for biofilm assemblages dominated by autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes, respectively, and then deployed CES in the river at each site for 18 - 26 days.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the deployment period, we used biofilms grown on CES to perform a series of in-stream incubations.  We measured respiration and productivity using a modified light-dark bottle incubation method and nitrogen fixation using an acetylene reduction assay. We measured biofilm biomass (chlorophyll a, ash-free dry mass) and calculated Autotrophic Index values (calculated as chlorophyll a concentration divided by ash-free dry mass). The CSV file \u201cnutrients pharmaceuticals biofilm response\u201d contains summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, count) of respiration rates, gross primary production rates, nitrogen fixation rates, chlorophyll a concentrations, ash-free dry mass, and Autotrophic Index values of biofilms on each contaminant treatment and substrate type at our study sites.  The Word document \u201cnutrients pharmaceuticals analytical methods\u201d describes the analytical methods used to measure chlorophyll and ash-free dry mass.\r\n\r\nTo examine microbial community composition of biofilms grown on CES, we used target metagenomics of the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes to identify bacterial and eukaryotic taxa, respectively.  Sequences were analyzed using Mothur (Schloss et al. 2009), operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified using Megablast at a minimum coverage of 99% and minimum pairwise identity of 97%, and phylogenetic identities aligned against the SILVA database (Glockner et al. 2017). The CSV files \u201cnutrients pharmaceuticals bacterial OTUs\u201d and \u201cnutrients pharmaceuticals eukaryote OTUs\u201d list the number of sequences of each bacterial and eukaryotic OTU, respectively, in contaminant treatments.  The CSV files \u201cnutrients pharmaceuticals bacterial tax\u201d and \u201cnutrients pharmaceuticals eukaryote tax\u201d contain taxonomic classification information for bacterial and eukaryotic OTUs, respectively.\r\n\r\nWe characterized light availability, water temperature, and nutrient concentrations at each study site.  Hemispherical photos taken of the overlying canopy and time series solar radiation data collected as part of the NSF-funded iUTAH project (Award number 1208732) were analyzed with Gap Light Analyzer software (Frazer et al. 1999). We estimated percent canopy openness, incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmitted through the canopy, and solar shortwave radiation transmitted through the canopy.  Degree days were calculated using time series water temperature data collected as part of the iUTAH project.  Water column samples collected at each site were analyzed for total and dissolved nutrients.  The CSV file \u201cnutrients pharmaceuticals site characteristics\u201d contains percent canopy openness, transmitted incoming PAR, transmitted solar shortwave radiation, degree days, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonium, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus, total dissolved iron, and total ferrous iron concentrations at each site.  The Word document \u201cnutrients pharmaceuticals analytical methods\u201d describes the analytical methods used to measure nutrient concentrations.\r\n\r\nWe examined water column pharmaceutical concentrations at one site on each river using Polar Organic Contaminant Integrative Samplers (POCIS).  POCIS were deployed for 20-26 days during low- and high-flow periods. The masses of 16 pharmaceuticals which had sorbed onto the POCIS were measured using high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry. We used the resulting pharmaceutical masses and uptake rates reported in the literature to calculate the time-weighted average concentration of each pharmaceutical.  Average daily discharge was calculated using time series discharge data collected by the iUTAH project.  The CSV file \u201cnutrients pharmaceuticals POCIS\u201d contains time-weighted average concentrations of 16 pharmaceuticals and average daily discharge at each site during low- and high-flow periods.title is Effects of nutrient and pharmaceutical additions on stream biofilms. creator is Ogata, Elizabeth. creator is Long, Donald. creator is Baker, Michelle. creator is Aanderud, Zachary. creator is Rosi, Emma. author is Ogata, Elizabeth. creator is Ogata, Elizabeth. creator is Long, Donald. creator is Baker, Michelle. creator is Aanderud, Zachary. creator is Rosi, Emma. subject is chlorophyll. subject is stream biofilms. subject is respiration. subject is contaminant exposure substrates. subject is nutrients. subject is microbial community composition. subject is nitrogen fixation. subject is pharmaceuticals. subject is water quality. subject is Polar Organic Contaminant Integrative Samplers. subject is ash-free dry mass. subject is iUTAH. subject is gross primary production. organization is Utah State University. organization is Southern Utah University. organization is Utah State University. organization is Brigham Young University. organization is Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. availability is private. coverage_type is box. coverage_type is period. format is text/csv. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Iutah Data manager. owner is Ogata, Elizabeth. owner is Baker, Michelle. extra is Observed Variables in site characteristics CSV file: total nitrogen (mg N/L), total phosphorus (mg P/L), ammonium (mg NH4-N/L), nitrate (mg NO3-N+NO2-N/L), soluble reactive phosphorus (mg SRP-P/L), total dissolved iron (ug/L), dissolved ferrous iron (ug/L),  percent canopy openness, transmitted photosynthetically active radiation (umols/m2/day), transmitted solar shortwave radiation (transmitted solar shortwave radiation; W/m2/day), degree days. extra is Observed Variables in pharmaceutical concentrations CSV file: average daily discharge (m3/s), caffeine concentration (ng/L), diphenhydramine concentration (ng/L), 1,7-dimethylxanthine concentration (ng/L), acetaminophen concentration (ng/L), amphetamine concentration (ng/L), carbamazepine concentration (ng/L), cimetidine concentration (ng/L), cotinine concentration (ng/L), MDA concentration (ng/L), MDMA concentration (ng/L), methamphetamine concentration (ng/L), morphine concentration (ng/L), sulfamethazine concentration (ng/L), sulfamethoxazole concentration (ng/L), thiabendazole concentration (ng/L), azithromycin concentration (ng/L), phenazone concentration (ng/L), sulfachloropyridazine concentration (ng/L), trimethoprim concentration (ng/L). extra is Observed Variables in biofilm response CSV file: gross primary production (mg O2/m2/hr), respiration (mg O2/m2/hr), nitrogen fixation rate (ug N2/m2/hr), chlorophyll a concentration (chl; mg/m2), ash-free dry mass (g/m2), Autotrophic Index (calculated as ash-free dry mass (mg/m2) divided by chlorophyll a concentration (mg/m2)).

 u"This Landlab tutorial example using radiation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) components.\r\n\r\n It uses DEM as input. Outputs are fields of: PET and solar radiation (incoming, net, and relative). Relative radiation is the ratio of shortwave radiation on a sloped surface to shortwave radiation on a flat surface for a given DOY and latitude. This ratio is used to scale net radiation on a flat surface across a watershed as well as to scale PET across the domain.   The component offers four different ways of setting PET on flat surface. Options: PET for flat surface can be set using one of the four methods, presented with the same name used in the instantiation of the component.\r\n\r\nNote: To use this tutorial, you should have Landlab (version 1.0) installed on your computer.

 u'These data are spatial data on landscape characteristics for Thunder Creek watershed in North Cascade mountains of Washington.  They include soil, geology, vegetation, topography, and landform data that can be used for earth surface analyses such as landslides and hydrology.  Elevation was acquired from STRM at 30 m grid scale, which the other datasets are matched to in scale and location.  Slope was derived from the elevation file and represents "tan theta".  Specific contributing area represents the area draining to each cell divided by the cell\'s width (so minimum value is 30 m).   Landform data was developed by Jon Riedel of National Park Service.  Landslides were extracted from these as "mass wasting" events.  Land use and land cover (LULC) data were acquired from USGS National land Cover Data (NLCD) based on 2011 Landsat satellite data and grouped into eight general categories.  Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) provides the source of  lithology in its surface geology maps that displays rocks and deposits as geologic map units.  These were aggregated into eight classes based on similarities in origin and generally increasing strength by Dr. Riedel.  Cohesion represent root cohesion based on the LULC ; soils are assumed to be primarily cohesionless, lacking \u201ctrue cohesion\u201d because of their low clay content in this mountain terrain.   Soil depth comes from NRCS soil survey depth-to-restricted layer (weighted-average aggregation) within each soil map unit. Transmissivity was derived from soil survey saturated hydraulic conductivity (depth averaged) and depth-to-restricted layer for each soil map unit. All soils within this watershed are sandy loam or loamy sand; therefore, soil surface texture was used as an indicator of internal angle of friction (phi).  A header file is also provided to understand the spatial details of the ascii files.  Projection for raster mapping is NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_10N.\n\n[Modified in JupyterHub on 2016-07-19 21:52:50.979003]\nThis is a demo of the HydroShare Python Notebook Servertitle is Hello From JupyterHub. creator is Hobley, Daniel. author is Hobley, Daniel. creator is Hobley, Daniel. subject is landscape characteristic. subject is landslide. subject is surface characteristic. subject is Thunder Creek. subject is JupyterHub. subject is Demo. availability is private. format is text/plain. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Hobley, Daniel.

 u'This example runs the \'landslide\' component of Landlab and is designed for undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning more about Landlab and landslide modeling.  Landlab is a Python-based landscape modeling environment and the landslide component is one of many components available for users to access and link together to build their own landscape model. For more information about Landlab, see http://landlab.github.io/#/.  Data needed for the example are spatial data on landscape characteristics for Thunder Creek watershed in North Cascade mountains of Washington.  They include soil, geology, vegetation, topography, and landform data that can be used for earth surface analyses such as landslides and hydrology.  Thus, the data can be used for more than this landslide example.  Elevation was acquired from STRM at 30 m grid scale;  the other datasets are matched to in scale and location.  Slope was derived from the elevation file and represents dimensionless "tan theta".  Specific contributing area represents the \'upstream\' area draining to each cell divided by the cell\'s width (so minimum value is 30 m).   Landform data was developed by Jon Riedel of National Park Service.  Landslides were extracted from these data as "mass wasting" events.  Land use and land cover (LULC) data were acquired from USGS National land Cover Data (NLCD) based on 2011 Landsat satellite data and grouped into eight general categories.  Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) provides the source of  lithology in its surface geology maps that displays rocks and deposits as geologic map units.  These were aggregated into eight classes based on similarities in origin and generally increasing strength by Dr. Riedel.  Cohesion represent root cohesion based on the LULC ; soils are assumed to be primarily cohesionless, lacking \u201ctrue cohesion\u201d because of their low clay content in this mountain terrain.   Soil depth comes from NRCS soil survey depth-to-restricted layer (weighted-average aggregation) within each soil map unit. Transmissivity was derived from the soil survey saturated hydraulic conductivity (depth averaged) multiplied by depth-to-restricted layer for each soil map unit. All soils within this watershed are sandy loam or loamy sand; therefore, soil surface texture was used as an indicator of internal angle of friction (phi).  A header file is also provided to understand the spatial details of the ASCII files and to facilitate capability with GIS.  Projection for raster mapping is NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_10N.\n\n[Modified in JupyterHub on 2016-07-19 19:39:30.499636]\nThis is a demo of the HydroShare Python Notebook Servertitle is Hello From JupyterHub. creator is Hutton, Eric. author is Hutton, Eric. creator is Hutton, Eric. subject is Demo. subject is JupyterHub. subject is surface characteristic. subject is landslide. subject is landscape characteristic. subject is Thunder Creek. availability is private. format is text/plain. format is application/ipynb. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Hutton, Eric.

Soil depth comes from NRCS soil survey depth-to-restricted layer (weighted-average aggregation) within each soil map unit. Transmissivity was derived from soil survey saturated hydraulic conductivity (depth averaged) and depth-to-restricted layer for each soil map unit. All soils within this watershed are sandy loam or loamy sand; therefore, soil surface texture was used as an indicator of internal angle of friction (phi).  A header file is also provided to understand the spatial details of the ascii files.  Projection for raster mapping is NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_10N.\n\n[Modified in JupyterHub on 2016-07-19 21:57:00.989243]\nThis is a demo of the HydroShare Python Notebook Server\n\n[Modified in JupyterHub on 2016-07-19 19:27:25.672424]\nThis is a demo of the HydroShare Python Notebook Servertitle is Hello From JupyterHub. creator is Hutton, Eric. author is Hutton, Eric. creator is Hutton, Eric. subject is Demo. subject is JupyterHub. subject is surface characteristic. subject is landslide. subject is landscape characteristic. subject is Thunder Creek. availability is private. format is text/plain. format is application/ipynb. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Hutton, Eric.

 u'This tutorial demonstrates implementation of the Cellular Automaton Tree-GRass-Shrub Simulator (CATGRaSS) [Zhou et al., 2013] on a flat domain. This model is built using components from the Landlab component library. CATGRaSS is spatially explicit model of plant coexistence. It simulates local ecohydrologic dynamics (soil moisture, transpiration, biomass) and spatial evolution of tree, grass, and shrub Plant Functional Types (PFT) driven by rainfall and solar radiation. \r\n\r\nEach cell in the model grid can hold a single PFT or remain empty. Tree and shrub plants disperse seeds to their neighbors. Grass seeds are assumed to be available at each cell. Establishment of plants in empty cells is determined probabilistically based on water stress of each PFT. Plants with lower water stress have higher probability of establishment. Plant mortality is simulated probabilistically as a result of aging and drought stress. Fires and grazing will be added to this model soon.  \r\n\r\nThis model (driver) contains:\r\n  - A local vegetation dynamics model that simulates storm and inter-storm water balance and ecohydrologic fluxes (ET, runoff), and plant biomass dynamics by coupling the following components:\r\n        - PrecipitationDistribution\r\n        - Radiation\r\n        - PotentialEvapotranspiration\r\n        - SoilMoisture\r\n        - Vegetation\r\n\r\n  - A spatially explicit probabilistic cellular automaton component that simulates plant competition by tracking establishment and mortality of plants based on soil moisture stress:\r\n        - VegCA\r\n    \r\nTo run this Jupyter notebook, please make sure that the following files are in the same folder:\r\n        - cellular_automaton_vegetation_flat_domain.ipynb (this notebook)\r\n        - Inputs_Vegetation_CA.txt (Input parameters for the model)\r\n        - Ecohyd_functions_flat.py (Utility functions)\r\n\r\n[Ref: Zhou, X, E.

 u'This example runs the \'landslide\' component of Landlab and is designed for undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning more about Landlab and landslide modeling.  Landlab is a Python-based landscape modeling environment and the landslide component is one of many components available for users to access and link together to build their own landscape model. For more information about Landlab, see http://landlab.github.io/#/.  Data needed for the example are spatial data on landscape characteristics for Thunder Creek watershed in North Cascade mountains of Washington.  They include soil, geology, vegetation, topography, and landform data that can be used for earth surface analyses such as landslides and hydrology.  Thus, the data can be used for more than this landslide example.  Elevation was acquired from STRM at 30 m grid scale;  the other datasets are matched to in scale and location.  Slope was derived from the elevation file and represents dimensionless "tan theta".  Specific contributing area represents the \'upstream\' area draining to each cell divided by the cell\'s width (so minimum value is 30 m).   Landform data was developed by Jon Riedel of National Park Service.  Landslides were extracted from these data as "mass wasting" events.  Land use and land cover (LULC) data were acquired from USGS National land Cover Data (NLCD) based on 2011 Landsat satellite data and grouped into eight general categories.  Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) provides the source of  lithology in its surface geology maps that displays rocks and deposits as geologic map units.  These were aggregated into eight classes based on similarities in origin and generally increasing strength by Dr. Riedel.  Cohesion represent root cohesion based on the LULC ; soils are assumed to be primarily cohesionless, lacking \u201ctrue cohesion\u201d because of their low clay content in this mountain terrain.   Soil depth comes from NRCS soil survey depth-to-restricted layer (weighted-average aggregation) within each soil map unit. Transmissivity was derived from the soil survey saturated hydraulic conductivity (depth averaged) multiplied by depth-to-restricted layer for each soil map unit. All soils within this watershed are sandy loam or loamy sand; therefore, soil surface texture was used as an indicator of internal angle of friction (phi).  A header file is also provided to understand the spatial details of the ASCII files and to facilitate capability with GIS.  Projection for raster mapping is NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_10N.\n\n[Modified in JupyterHub on 2016-07-22 18:04:36.628088]\nThis is a demo of the HydroShare Python Notebook Servertitle is Landlab Landslide. creator is Beveridge, Claire. author is Beveridge, Claire. creator is Beveridge, Claire. subject is JupyterHub. subject is Demo. subject is Thunder Creek. subject is landscape characteristic. subject is landslide. subject is surface characteristic. availability is private. format is text/plain. format is application/ipynb. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Beveridge, Claire.

 u"This dataset uses Census Data following published social vulnerability index literature to provide an index at the Place level.\r\n\r\nThe Corps of Engineers has chosen SoVI as the \u201cfoundational SVA (Social Vulnerability Analysis) method for characterizing social vulnerability\u2026.\u201d (Dunning and Durden 2013) The University of South Carolina has provided extensive and historic data for this methodology. Susan Cutter and her team have published their methodology and continue to maintain their database. Thus it was chosen as the \u201cprimary tool for [Army] Corps SVA applications.\u201d (ibid) The downside is that this method is complex and hard to communicate and understand at times. (S. Cutter, Boruff, and Shirley 2003) The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) for this study was constructed at the U.S. Census Place level for the state of Utah. We utilized the conventions put forth by Cutter (2011) as closely as possible using the five-year American Community Survey (ACS) data from 2008 to 2012. The ACS collects a different, more expansive set of variables than the Census Long Form utilized in Cutter et al. (2003), which required some deviation in variable selection from the original method. However, Holand and Lujala (2013) demonstrated that the SoVI could be constructed using regional contextually appropriate variables rather than the specific variables presented by Cutter et al. (2003). Where possible, variables were selected which matched with the Cutter et al. (2003) work. The Principle Components Analysis was conducted using the statistical software R version 3.2.3 (R 2015) and the prcomp function. Using the Cutter (2011) conventions for component selection, we chose to use the first ten principle components which explained 76% of the variance in the data. Once the components were selected, we assessed the correlation coefficients for each component and determined the tendency (how it increases or decreases) of each component for calculating the final index values. With the component tendencies assessed, we created an arithmetic function to calculate the final index scores in ESRI\u2019s ArcGIS software (ESRI 2014). The scores were then classified using an equal interval classification in ArcGIS to produce five classes of vulnerability, ranging from very low to very high. The SoVI constructed for our study is largely consistent with previous indices published by Susan Cutter at a macro scale, which were used as a crude validation for the analysis. The pattern of vulnerability in the state is clustered, with the lowest vulnerability in the most densely populated area of the state, centered on Salt Lake City (see Figure [UT_SoVI.png]). Most of the state falls in the moderate vulnerability class, which is to be expected.title is Social Vulnerability at the Census Place level. creator is Wheelwright, Matthew. author is Wheelwright, Matthew. creator is Wheelwright, Matthew. contributor is Ganning, Joanna. contributor is Hile, Ryan. contributor is Flint, Courtney. subject is SoVI. subject is Social Vulnerability. subject is iUTAH. subject is census. availability is public. coverage_type is box. coverage_type is period. format is text/plain. format is application/zip. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Iutah Data manager. owner is Wheelwright, Matthew. owner is Flint, Courtney. extra is Data Collection Method: Utilized select variables from ACS 2008-2012 datasets.

 u"This dataset contains important categories (per an extensive literature review) in relation to vulnerability to water hazards within Utah at the Census Place level (i.e. cities). Although social and physical vulnerability to water hazards (i.e. flooding) data has been collected extensively in many coastal areas, this is a costly problem in Utah and many other non-coastal regions. The variables shown here are categorized by type and collection method. 1. General data is shown for all Census Places in Utah including County, Geocode, and Total Population. These are taken from the 2010 Census. 2. Literature suggests that there are various approaches which local governments take to mitigate the impacts of flood events. Indicators of these approaches are captured in the section entitled Web Survey. A web survey was conducted of each and every census place in Utah. The data includes evaluations of content including water hazard education, land use restrictions described in the code, freeboard requirements, and emergency operations plan implementations. 3. Information about the local government including their planning and building inspector staff was collected using a phone survey along with emails and website investigations. 4. FEMA data was consolidated from FEMA's website showing census places with current insurance premium discounts achieved by demonstrating compliance with certain federal requirements. It also includes data on policies and losses. 5. A social vulnerability index was created by our team for this project and details can be found here: http://repository.iutahepscor.org/dataset/social-vulnerability-at-the-census-place-level. This dataset includes summary findings from the SoVI index. 6. As housing is recognized in the literature as a contributer to natural hazard vulnerability, important housing statistics were defined and created from Census data. These include housing age, median value, and renter occupied statistics. A standardized rating of building code effectiveness is also included from a recent Utah Hazard Mitigation Report. 7. Event data is summarized for number of events and estimated monetary damages from another of our team's datasets found here: http://repository.iutahepscor.org/dataset/noaa-storm-events. This NOAA dataset helps us understand the nature of past experience and physical exposure to water hazards. 8. As this dataset is focused on water hazard exposure, two measurements were calculated for each census place reflecting the percentage area of the city included in the defined special flood hazard area.\r\n\r\nTogether these data paint a picture of Utah's vulnerabilities to flood hazards and potential exposure to other natural hazard events.

 u"This dataset contains the urban growth simulation results of future land use in 2040 of the Wasatch Range Metropolitan Area (WRMA) .In this study, we defined the WRMA as a broad, ten-county region that surrounds the Wasatch Mountain Range east of the Great Salt Lake and Salt Lake City in Utah. This region encompasses four Wasatch Front counties west of the mountain range (Weber County, Davis County, Salt Lake County, and Utah County), three Wasatch Back counties east of the mountain range (Morgan County, Summit County, and Wasatch County), and three counties neighboring the Wasatch Front (Cache County, Box Elder County, and Tooele County). \r\n\r\nSLEUTH-3r urban growth simulation model is used to generate this dataset. Detailed SLEUTH model protocol can be found at: http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/projects/gig/index.html. The data used to run the SLEUTH-3r model include National Land Cover Database 2001, 2006, and 2011, US Census TIGER/Line shapefile for 2000 and 2011, United States Geological Survey  7.5 min elevation model, and Utah Landownership map from Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center. \r\n\r\nThree alternative scenarios were developed to explore how conserving Utah\u2019s agriculturale land and maintaining healthy watersheds would affect the patterns and trajectories of urban development:\r\n1) The first scenario is a \u201cBusiness as Usual\u201d scenario. In this scenario, federal, state, and local parks, conservation easement areas, and surface water bodies, were completely excluded (value = 100) from development, and all the remaining lands are were naively assumed as developable (value = 0). This is the same excluded layer that was also used during model calibration. Under this scenario, we hypothesized that future urban grow will occur following the historical growth behaviors and trajectories and no changes in land designation or policies to restrict future growth will be implemented.\r\n2) The second scenario is an \u201cAgricultural Conservation\u201d scenario. Within the developable areas that we identified earlier, we then identified places that are classified by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as prime farmland, unique farmland, farmland of statewide importance, farmland of local importance, prime farmland if irrigated, and prime farmland if irrigated and drained. Each of these classes were assigned with an exclusion value from urban development of 100, 80, 70, 60, 50, and 40 respectively. These exclusion values reflect the relative importance of each farmland classification and preservation priorities. By doing so, the model discourages but does not totally eliminate growth from occurring on agricultural lands, which reflects a general policy position to conserve agricultural landscapes while respecting landowners\u2019 rights to sell private property.\r\n3) A \u201cHealthy Watershed\u201d scenario aims to direct urban growth away from areas prone to flooding and areas critical for maintaining healthy watersheds. First, we made a 200-meter buffer around existing surface water bodies and wetlands and assigned these areas an exclusion value of 100 to keep growth from occurring there. In addition, we assigned areas that have frequent, occasional, rare and no-recorded flooding events with exclusion values of 100, 70, 40 and 0 accordingly. We also incorporated the critical watershed restoration areas identified by the Watershed Restoration Initiative of Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (https://wri.utah.gov/wri/) into this scenario. These watershed restoration areas are priority places for improving water quality and yield, reducing catastrophic wildfires, restoring the structure and function of watersheds following wildfire, and increasing habitat for wildlife populations and forage for sustainable agriculture. However, there are not yet legal provisions for protecting them from urbanization, so we assigned these areas a value of 70 to explore the potential urban expansion outcomes if growth were encouraged elsewhere.\r\n\r\n Future land use projections of 2040 are in GIF format, which can be reprojected and georeferenced in ArcGIS or QGIS, or be read directly as a picture.title is Future WRMA's Land Use Dataset. creator is Li, Enjie. author is Li, Enjie. creator is Li, Enjie. contributor is Endter-wada, Joanna. contributor is Li, Shujuan. subject is NLCD. subject is SLEUTH. subject is WRMA. subject is future. subject is future land use projection. subject is land use. subject is urban. subject is urban growth simulation. subject is iUTAH. availability is public. coverage_type is box. coverage_type is period. format is image/gif. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Iutah Data manager. owner is Li, Enjie. extra is Data Collection Method: Data used for SLEUTH urban growth model include: NLCD of year 1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011, slope, hillshade, landownership, water, and conservation easement areas, and roads.

 u"The most traditional way to examine land use change is to use a cross-tabulation matrix to identify the most important categorical land use transition from time 1 to time 2. However, such method does not necessarily capture or indicate the real changes on the landscape. For example, assuming that from 1986 to 2015, Utah\u2019s total agricultural land loss (aka, net change) is 200 square miles, but this does not mean that only 200 square miles of agricultural land have experienced land use change in the last 30 years. It is highly possible that a given quantity of agricultural land loss at one location can be accompanied by another quantity of agricultural land gain at another location (aka, swapping). Thus, by purely using net change, we might fail to capture the swapping component of change, and fail to capture the intricate transitions of landscape. This dataset analyzed important categorical land use change while account for persistence and swaps. It provides additional information concerning what happened on the landscape.\r\n\r\nThis dataset includes a statistical table and a GIS raster file. The table summarizes the persistence and swaps, as well as gross gain and gross loss in the Wasatch Range Metropolitan Area (WRMA). The GIS file is the compiled spatial layer that represents the gain, loss, persistence, and swaps on the landscape. We used Water Related Land Use data of Year 1986 to Year 2015 for this analysis. Land use categories used in this dataset include urban (URB), irrigated agricultural land (IR), and non-irrigated agricultural land (NI), sub-irrigated agricultural land (SubIR), riparian (RIP), water, (WATER), and other (OTHER). We then examined the categorical land use changes with a transition matrix.\r\n\r\nA categorical land use gain is determined as the conversion from other sources to this particular categorical land use, and a categorical land use loss is defined as conversion from this particular categorical land use to other uses. For example, the gain of irrigated agricultural (IR) land use will be the sum of areas of urban to IR, non-irrigated agricultural land to IR, sub-irrigated agricultural land to IR, riparian to IR, water to IR, and other to IR. The total change is calculated as the sum of gain and loss. The net change equals to |Gain|-|Loss|.

 u"Researchers at Utah State University created a short survey instrument to gather information about the views and concerns of Utah residents related to water issues. This survey was designed to give the public a chance to share their perceptions and concerns about water supply, water quality, and other related issues. While finding out what the \u2018average citizen\u2019 feels about key water issues was one goal of the project, the most interesting and important results are found in exploring ways in which perspectives about water vary across the population based on where people live and their demographic background (gender, age, education, etc.). This survey helps bring a voice to groups of citizens typically not represented in water policy debates. The findings have been and continue to be shared with water managers and decision makers who are planning for local and state water system sustainability. \r\n\r\nThis survey effort is also a key outreach and education component of the iUTAH project. High school groups, college and university classes, and others are invited to collaborate with iUTAH faculty to conduct public intercept surveys. Co-collection and analysis of survey data provides a hands-on learning opportunity about the principles of social science research. This effort helps increase awareness about the complexity of water issues in Utah, and the methods through which scientists learn about the public\u2019s thoughts and concerns. Between July 2014 and April 2016, the survey has been implemented with collaborating students and faculty from the University of Utah, Utah Valley University, Weber State University, Salt Lake Community College, Southern Utah University, Dixie State University, and Snow College. \r\n\r\nThe survey involved using a structured protocol to randomly approach adults entering grocery stores in communities across the state, and inviting them to complete a 3-minute questionnaire about thier perceptions and concerns about water issues in Utah. The survey was self-administered on an iPad tablet and uploaded to a web server using the Qualtrics Offline App.   \r\n\r\nThe project generated responses from over 7,000 adults, with a response rate of just over 42% . Comparisons of the respondents with census data suggest that they are largely representative of the communities where data were collected and of the state's adult population. \r\n\r\nThe data are anonymous and are available as a public dataset here.  The data also served as the basis for the development of an open-source web-based survey data viewer that can be found at: http://data.iutahepscor.org/surveys/ and were also reported in Jones et al. (2016).  We encourage users to use the viewer to explore the survey results.\r\n\r\nThe files below include a document describing in detail the method/protocol used in the study, and copies of field materials we used to implement the project.

 u'The objective of this study is to incorporate a time-dependent Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) based Curve Number method (SMA_CN) in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and compare its performance with the existing CN method in SWAT by simulating the hydrology of two agricultural watersheds in Indiana, USA. Results show that fusion of the SMA_CN method causes decrease in runoff volume and increase in profile soil moisture content, associated with larger groundwater contribution to the streamflow. In addition, the higher amount of moisture in the soil profile slightly elevates the actual evapotranspiration. The SMA-based SWAT configuration consistently produces improved goodness-of-fit scores and less uncertain outputs with respect to streamflow during both calibration and validation. The SMA_CN method exhibits a better match with the observed data for all flow regimes, thereby addressing issues related to peak and low flow predictions by SWAT in many past studies. Comparison of the calibrated model outputs with field-scale soil moisture observations reveals that the SMA overhauling enables SWAT to represent soil moisture condition more accurately, with better response to the incident rainfall dynamics. While the results from the modification of the CN method in SWAT are promising, more studies including watersheds with various physical and climatic settings are needed to validate the proposed approach.title is Modified SWAT model for Cedar Creek, IN. creator is Rajib, Adnan. creator is Venkatesh Merwade. author is Rajib, Adnan. creator is Rajib, Adnan. creator is Venkatesh Merwade. subject is Soil Moisture Accounting. subject is SWAT. subject is Cedar Creek. subject is Curve Number. subject is Runoff. organization is Purdue University. organization is Purdue University. availability is public. format is application/zip. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is SWAT Model Instance Resource. owner is Rajib, Adnan. extra is Publication: DOI: 10.1002/hyp.10639.

 u'The Wasatch Mountain Voices Project seeks to assess perceptions of values and vulnerabilities associated with the Wasatch Mountains. The connection to iUTAH research focuses on the degree to which water is mentioned by key informants interviewed for this project. A team of undergraduate research assistants assisted with this project and conducted interviews. It should be noted that this effort was a learning experience for students and a few inherent limitations are found in the flow of the interviews as a result of students in early stages of climbing the interview learning curve. We acknowledge some leading aspects in interview questions. However, a standard set of questions was asked in all interviews. \r\n\r\nInterviews were conducted with representatives of the following categories:\r\n\r\n1. City Planners\r\n2. Emergency Managers\r\n3. Natural Resource Managers (state or federal)\r\n4. Representatives from environmental interest groups or organizations\r\n5. Representatives of recreational interests\r\n6. Representatives of Real Estate, Commercial/Economic or Development Interests\r\n\r\nWe used web-based information and existing contacts in the region to identify people in the categories to sample from for interviews. Interviews were largely held in person, but sometimes by phone. Key informant interviews followed a semi-structured format and lasted from 30 to 60 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhile 90 people were originally interviewed, 2 were not audio recorded and 7 were people who declined to share their anonymous transcript. Thus this dataset contains 81 complete interview transcripts. Interviews were conducted with  people from  five different regions: Northen Wasatch, Central Wasatch, Wasatch Front, Wasatch Back, and Southern Wasatch. Interviews were held at a location convenient to the participant. \r\n\r\nAt the outset of the interviews, participants were presented with a letter of information describing informed consent procedures. When consent was given, interviews were audio recorded. Participants were given the opportunity to choose whether or not they want to be identified in project reporting. For those choosing not to be identified, any identifying information was redacted from transcripts.\r\n\r\nTranscripts made from audio files used an ID system for identification and were created using NVivo software. Though initially planned to be shared, audio interview files were deleted upon the request by USU IRB. \r\n\r\nThe questions guiding the interviews were as follows:\r\n\r\n1. How do the Wasatch Mountains influence the wellbeing in this area? In other words, what are some of the values or benefits of living in the Wasatch Mountain Region?\r\n2. Are there any disadvantages or particular vulnerabilities related to the Wasatch Mountains that compromise or decrease wellbeing in this area?\r\n3. What do you think are the key issues regarding the future sustainability and wellbeing of the Wasatch Mountain Region?\r\n4. Are you aware of any efforts underway to help sustain or improve the wellbeing of the Wasatch Mountain Region in the future? Are you \u2013 or is your organization - involved in these efforts?

 u'This example runs the \'landslide\' component of Landlab and is designed for undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning more about Landlab and landslide modeling.  Landlab is a Python-based landscape modeling environment and the landslide component is one of many components available for users to access and link together to build their own landscape model. For more information about Landlab, see http://landlab.github.io/#/.  Data needed for the example are spatial data on landscape characteristics for Thunder Creek watershed in North Cascade mountains of Washington.  They include soil, geology, vegetation, topography, and landform data that can be used for earth surface analyses such as landslides and hydrology.  Thus, the data can be used for more than this landslide example.  Elevation was acquired from STRM at 30 m grid scale;  the other datasets are matched to in scale and location.  Slope was derived from the elevation file and represents dimensionless "tan theta".  Specific contributing area represents the \'upstream\' area draining to each cell divided by the cell\'s width (so minimum value is 30 m).   Landform data was developed by Jon Riedel of National Park Service.  Landslides were extracted from these data as "mass wasting" events.  Land use and land cover (LULC) data were acquired from USGS National land Cover Data (NLCD) based on 2011 Landsat satellite data and grouped into eight general categories.  Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) provides the source of  lithology in its surface geology maps that displays rocks and deposits as geologic map units.  These were aggregated into eight classes based on similarities in origin and generally increasing strength by Dr. Riedel.  Cohesion represent root cohesion based on the LULC ; soils are assumed to be primarily cohesionless, lacking \u201ctrue cohesion\u201d because of their low clay content in this mountain terrain.   Soil depth comes from NRCS soil survey depth-to-restricted layer (weighted-average aggregation) within each soil map unit. Transmissivity was derived from the soil survey saturated hydraulic conductivity (depth averaged) multiplied by depth-to-restricted layer for each soil map unit. All soils within this watershed are sandy loam or loamy sand; therefore, soil surface texture was used as an indicator of internal angle of friction (phi).  A header file is also provided to understand the spatial details of the ASCII files and to facilitate capability with GIS.  Projection for raster mapping is NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_10N.\n\n[Modified in JupyterHub on 2016-07-26 20:37:55.116581]\nThis is a demo of the HydroShare Python Notebook Servertitle is Hello From JupyterHub. creator is Scaife, Charles. author is Scaife, Charles. creator is Scaife, Charles. subject is Demo. subject is landscape characteristic. subject is landslide. subject is surface characteristic. subject is JupyterHub. subject is Thunder Creek. availability is private. format is text/plain. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Scaife, Charles.

 u'This tutorial demonstrates implementation of the Cellular Automaton Tree-GRass-Shrub Simulator (CATGRaSS) [Zhou et al., 2013] on a flat domain. This model is built using components from the Landlab component library. CATGRaSS is spatially explicit model of plant coexistence. It simulates local ecohydrologic dynamics (soil moisture, transpiration, biomass) and spatial evolution of tree, grass, and shrub Plant Functional Types (PFT) driven by rainfall and solar radiation. \r\n\r\nEach cell in the model grid can hold a single PFT or remain empty. Tree and shrub plants disperse seeds to their neighbors. Grass seeds are assumed to be available at each cell. Establishment of plants in empty cells is determined probabilistically based on water stress of each PFT. Plants with lower water stress have higher probability of establishment. Plant mortality is simulated probabilistically as a result of aging and drought stress.

 u'This tutorial demonstrates implementation of the Cellular Automaton Tree-GRass-Shrub Simulator (CATGRaSS) [Zhou et al., 2013] on a digital elevation model (DEM). This model is built using components from the Landlab component library. CATGRaSS is a spatially explicit model of plant coexistence. It simulates local ecohydrologic dynamics (soil moisture, transpiration, biomass) and spatial evolution of tree, grass, and shrub Plant Functional Types (PFT) driven by rainfall and solar radiation. \r\n\r\nEach cell in the model grid can hold a single PFT or remain empty. Tree and shrub plants disperse seeds to their neighbors. Grass seeds are assumed to be available at each cell. Establishment of plants in empty cells is determined probabilistically based on water stress for each PFT. Plants with lower water stress have higher probability of establishment. Plant mortality is simulated probabilistically as a result of aging and drought stress. Fires and grazing will be added to this model soon.  \r\n\r\nThis model (driver) contains:\r\n- A local vegetation dynamics model that simulates storm and inter-storm water balance and ecohydrologic fluxes (ET, runoff), and plant biomass dynamics by coupling the following components:\r\n    - PrecipitationDistribution\r\n    - Radiation\r\n    - PotentialEvapotranspiration\r\n    - SoilMoisture\r\n    - Vegetation\r\n\r\n- A spatially explicit probabilistic cellular automaton component that simulates plant competition by tracking establishment and mortality of plants based on soil moisture stress:\r\n    - VegCA\r\n    \r\nTo run this Jupyter notebook, please make sure that the following files are in the same folder:\r\n - cellular_automaton_vegetation_DEM.ipynb (this notebook)\r\n - Inputs_Vegetation_CA.txt (Input parameters for the model)\r\n - Ecohyd_functions_DEM.py (Utility functions)\r\n    \r\n[Ref: Zhou, X, E.

 u'Overview:\r\nTopnet-WM refers to the Water Management version of Topnet developed as a work product for the Utah State University WRIA 1 Watershed Management Project (Tarboton, 2007). This version of the model evolved from the Topnet Model developed in a collaboration between NIWA New Zealand and Utah State University (Bandaragoda et al., 2004; Ibbitt and Woods, 2004) that combines TOPMODEL concepts (Beven and Kirkby, 1979; Beven et al., 1995a) for the simulation of relatively small drainages combined with channel routing. This approach provides a modeling system that can be applied over large watersheds using smaller drainages within the large watershed as model elements. \r\n\r\nIn Topnet-WM, spatial variability is represented by subdividing the watershed domain into model elements at the scale of drainages. Within drainages, the modeling is essentially lumped but includes parameterization of some subgrid variability, notably (1) the wetness index, used to parameterize the variability of soil moisture, (2) a depletion curve, used to parameterize the variability of snow water equivalent, (3) the fraction of area that is irrigated, and (4) areas with artificial drainage. Surface runoff and baseflow can be designated as model outputs at multiple nodes within a drainage. The model may thus be classified as semi-distributed.\r\n\r\nTopnet-WM includes many enhancements beyond the original Beven and Kirkby TOPMODEL, such as: (1) calculation of reference evapotranspiration using the ASCE standardized Penman-Monteith method (Allen et al., 2005; Jensen et al., 1990); (2) calculation of snowmelt using the Utah Energy Balance Snowmelt model (Tarboton et al., 1995a); (3) the partition of model elements into separate components representing irrigated and non-irrigated areas; (4) artificial drainage to represent the effect of ditch and tile drained areas on the runoff response; (5) the partition of the model elements into pervious and impervious areas to allow representation of urbanization; (6) options for the diversion and storage of water under different management options; and (7) components to calculate water use and implement water right rules. \r\n\r\nThe Lower Nooksack Water Budget will be estimated based on the distributed hydrologic model, Topnet-WM. The Lower Nooksack Water Budget included updating the data inputs and model calibration, which requires a thorough understanding of how the model represents physical hydrologic processes. In order to guide the development of model inputs and analysis of model outputs, the project team has edited and reviewed portions of the WRIA 1 Water Management Project Phase III Task 4.1 report (Tarboton, 2007) to include in the general description of the Topnet-WM model that follows. This chapter provides reference to the details of the model processes used by Topnet-WM to convert data inputs into model outputs. \r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the LNWB Ch02 Model Processes Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch02 Model Processes - model code. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Tarboton, David. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Tarboton, David. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Mariza Costa-Cabral. contributor is Freimund, Jeremy. contributor is Gill, Peter. contributor is Greenberg, Joanne. subject is hydrologic model. organization is University of Washington. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. format is application/zip. format is application/x-msdos-program. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Phuong, Jimmy. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u'Overview:\r\nThe Lower Nooksack Water Budget Project involved assembling a wide range of existing data related to WRIA 1 and specifically the Lower Nooksack Subbasin, updating existing data sets and generating new data sets. This Data Management Plan provides an overview of the data sets, formats and collaboration environment that was used to develop the project. Use of a plan during development of the technical work products provided a forum for the data development and management to be conducted with transparent methods and processes. At project completion, the Data Management Plan provides an accessible archive of the data resources used and supporting information on the data storage, intended access, sharing and re-use guidelines. \r\n\r\nOne goal of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget project is to make this \u201cusable technical information\u201d as accessible as possible across technical, policy and general public users. The project data, analyses and documents will be made available through the WRIA 1 Watershed Management Project website http://wria1project.org. This information is intended for use by the WRIA 1 Joint Board and partners working to achieve the adopted goals and priorities of the WRIA 1 Watershed Management Plan. \r\n\r\nModel outputs for the Lower Nooksack Water Budget are summarized by sub-watersheds (drainages) and point locations (nodes). In general, due to changes in land use over time and changes to available streamflow and climate data, the water budget for any watershed needs to be updated periodically. Further detailed information about data sources is provided in review packets developed for specific technical components including climate, streamflow and groundwater level, soils and land cover, and water use.\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nThis project involves assembling a wide range of existing data related to the WRIA 1 and specifically the Lower Nooksack Subbasin, updating existing data sets and generating new data sets. Data will be used as input to various hydrologic, climatic and geomorphic components of the Topnet-Water Management (WM) model, but will also be available to support other modeling efforts in WRIA 1. Much of the data used as input to the Topnet model is publicly available and maintained by others, (i.e., USGS DEMs and streamflow data, SSURGO soils data, University of Washington gridded meteorological data). Pre-processing is performed to convert these existing data into a format that can be used as input to the Topnet model. Post-processing of Topnet model ASCII-text file outputs is subsequently combined with spatial data to generate GIS data that can be used to create maps and illustrations of the spatial distribution of water information. Other products generated during this project will include documentation of methods, input by WRIA 1 Joint Board Staff Team during review and comment periods, communication tools developed for public engagement and public comment on the project.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain an organized system of developing and distributing data, Lower Nooksack Water Budget project collaborators should be familiar with standards for data management described in this document, and the following issues related to generating and distributing data:\r\n1. Standards for metadata and data formats\r\n2. Plans for short-term storage and data management (i.e., file formats, local storage and back up procedures and security)\r\n3. Legal and ethical issues (i.e., intellectual property, confidentiality of study participants)\r\n4. Access policies and provisions (i.e., how the data will be made available to others, any restrictions needed)\r\n5. Provisions for long-term archiving and preservation (i.e., establishment of a new data archive or utilization of an existing archive)\r\n6. Assigned data management responsibilities (i.e., persons responsible for ensuring data Management, monitoring compliance with the Data Management Plan)\r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the LNWB Ch03 Data Processes Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch03 Data Processes - data management plan. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Capen, Bracken. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. creator is Dumas, Mary. creator is Gill, Peter. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Capen, Bracken. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. creator is Dumas, Mary. creator is Gill, Peter. contributor is Freimund, Jeremy. subject is Data Dictionary. subject is Database Schema. subject is TOPNET WM Model. organization is University of Washington. organization is Washington State University. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. organization is Dumas & Associates. organization is Whatcom County Public Works. availability is public. format is application/x-sql. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Phuong, Jimmy. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u'Overview:\r\nThe model of watershed hydrology and water management used for the Lower Nooksack Water Budget is Topnet-WM, developed for Water Resources Inventory Area 1 (WRIA 1) in an effort led by researchers from Utah State University, as reported in peer-reviewed publications (Bandaragoda et al., 2004; Ibbitt and Woods, 2004; Tarboton, 2007). The model has also been applied, at finer spatial resolution, to the Fishtrap Creek and Bertrand Creek watersheds (Bandaragoda, 2008; Bandaragoda and Greenberg, 2009). The model processes of Topnet-WM are described in detail in Chapter 2 Model Processes. The daily meteorological variables required by Topnet-WM are precipitation, temperature (minimum and maximum), and wind speed.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Lower Nooksack Water Budget project, WRIA 1 Topnet-WM used interpolated climate data (1946-2006) from 19 weather stations located within or near the WRIA 1 boundary. A significant component of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget Project was to update Topnet-WM to use the high resolution (1/8 lat/long degree; approximately one data point every 8 miles) gridded climate dataset that is updated and distributed, on an ongoing basis, by the University of Washington (UW) Land Surface Hydrology Research Group1 , following methods described in Maurer et. al. (2002) and Hamlet and Lettenmaier (2005). This dataset includes daily precipitation, wind speed, and daily maximum and minimum temperatures over the 1915 through 2011 water years (October 1 through September 30).\r\n\r\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of the updated mean annual precipitation distribution derived from the Lower Nooksack Water Budget Topnet-WM gridded climate data for the 172 drainages (black dots) in WRIA 1. The lowest annual precipitation values are around Lummi Island and Bellingham (31-38 inches per year) and the highest precipitation values are near Mount Baker (121-207 inches per year). The increase in annual precipitation follows a gradient of increase from the west coast of the watershed to the eastern mountains, reflecting the role of orographic uplift of moist oceanic air masses in generating precipitation in this region. \r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nThe purpose for updating climate data used for watershed model inputs is to use the most current and up to date datasets. For the Lower Nooksack Water Budget Topnet-WM model, this includes new Snotel stations, an additional 8 years of daily climate data, and a higher resolution data product, compared to the initially developed Topnet-WM (Tarboton, 2007), which was populated with climate data ending in 2004. Updated climate data helps build our knowledge of the watershed system, since we have more information about when and where water is input to the system as rain and/or snow. \r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget (LNWB) Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch04 Climate Data. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. contributor is Tarboton, David. contributor is Freimund, Jeremy. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Mariza Costa-Cabral. contributor is Gill, Peter. contributor is Capen, Bracken. subject is annual precipitation values. subject is Climate data outputs. subject is mapping files. subject is Climate data processing. organization is University of Washington. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. availability is public. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/66614536629146748c78ca799540b1b3/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/120eac90fa3b45bab473e1914f686ca0/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/3b6d4604e82745308f7293d10a5f2349/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/52c392aa8833445e9dfc1a0cb721e087/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Phuong, Jimmy.

 u'Overview:\r\nLand cover mapping represents the coverage of vegetation, bare, wet and built surfaces (developed and natural surfaces) at a given point in time. The existing land cover map was developed by Whatcom County Planning and Development Services (PDS) during spring of 2012 for the Lower Nooksack Water Budget. The dataset represents ground conditions between 2006 and 2010. The project team created the existing condition land cover dataset by combining local and regional datasets to get the most accurate and current data for the U.S. and Canadian portions of WRIA 1. The development of the existing land cover map includes 14 land cover categories; each has a unique impact on the water balance. The agricultural land cover class was further classified into crop types. \r\n\r\nLand cover and crop types influence evapotranspiration and infiltration, playing an important role in determining the watershed\u2019s water balance. Land cover data provides information used to parameterize the water movement through the vegetation canopy and water demand of plant evapotranspiration in the estimation of the water budget by the hydrology model. \r\n\r\nLand cover changes over time, as exemplified by comparing the existing and historic land cover data in WRIA 1, displayed in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Historic land cover mapping developed by Utah State University (Winkelaar, 2004) as part of the WRIA 1 Watershed Management Project was used to represent land cover/land use for the undepleted flow simulations. This work was done using a suite of studies and ancillary datasets, including turn of the century GLO maps and NRCS soils data. Methods and sources more thoroughly described in Mapping Methodology and Data Sources for Historic Conditions Landuse/ Landcover Within Water Resource Inventory Area 1 (WRIA1) Washington, U.S.A. The historic land cover map includes 10 land cover classes. \r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nWithin the Topnet-WM hydrologic model used to estimate the Lower Nooksack Water Budget, the local land cover type is used to parameterize the water movement through the vegetation canopy and water demand for plant evapotranspiration, as described in detail in Chapter 2: Water Budget Model. Water input to the canopy comes from rainfall, snowmelt, and irrigation. The process of some water retention by the canopy is known as interception. Potential evapotranspiration is first satisfied from the canopy interception storage. Water that passes through the canopy to the soil becomes input to the vadose zone soil storage. The vadose zone is the unsaturated soil region above the water table. Potential evapotranspiration not satisfied from the interception storage becomes potential evapotranspiration from the vadose zone soil storage. The model calculates crop evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith method. Irrigation requirements are calculated using potential crop evapotranspiration and irrigation efficiency. Land cover mapping also identifies impervious surfaces where water directly runs off, as well as lakes and wetlands where water is stored and evaporates. \r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget (LNWB) Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch05 Land Cover. creator is Gill, Peter. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. author is Gill, Peter. creator is Gill, Peter. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Mariza Costa-Cabral. contributor is Capen, Bracken. subject is Ground conditions. subject is land cover model parameter values. subject is calculating basin parameter values. subject is land cover codes. subject is Lower Nooksack subbasin. subject is WRIA1. subject is land cover layers. subject is shape files. subject is Whatcom county. organization is Whatcom County Public Works. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. organization is University of Washington. availability is public. coverage_type is box. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/173b983c535a47e2a39924aea869688c/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/207c37ac2733409792965d903bf1a45b/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/ee8ad4fd6c484041950d597a19b9f21e/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/66a39dc5f80b4d90a4366a720928e3ad/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/e628c40866fb45949bb943b7dea5e162/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Phuong, Jimmy.

 u'Overview:\r\nWater, in its many forms is one of Whatcom County\u2019s signature features from snow-capped mountains,to our rainy climate, salmon-bearing streams, wetlands, lakes, marine waters, and marine shorelines. Five distinct hydrologic components control the storage and movement of water through the canopy and soils: canopy interception store (green trees), upper soil zone (vadose zone, brown soil fill) store, groundwater saturated zone (gray soil fill), channel flow (blue), and artificial drainage (blue line from agriculture to channel). Surface water inputs from direct precipitation, throughfall through the vegetation canopy, and irrigation are taken as input to the unsaturated, or vadose zone soil store. The unsaturated portion of the upper soil layer (brown), or vadose zone, is shown with recharge water (blue downward line) infiltrating the surface layer of soils, draining through the unsaturated zone (brown), to recharge the saturated zone (gray). The thickness of the vadose zone changes as the water table level (hashed gray and brown interface) shifts up and down, depending on the water held in the saturated zone. Based on the input and storage in the vadose zone, recharge to groundwater (gray, saturated zone) and surface water runoff is calculated. The vadose zone soil store is decreased by artificial drainage, representing ditch and tile drains that remove water directly from the vadose zone soil store to channels. The vadose zone soil store calculation also accounts for potential upwelling from groundwater where the water table is shallow. The groundwater saturated zone calculations account for recharge, upwelling and groundwater pumping and produce baseflow as an output. In the Lower Nooksack Water Budget, baseflow is defined as the outflow from the saturated zone and referred to as groundwater contribution; and baseflow and surface runoff are combined to calculate channel flow.\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nThe baseflow in streams is supported by the gradual drainage of groundwater in shallow aquifer systems. The rate of this drainage depends on the amount of water stored in shallow aquifers (depth to water table) and the hydraulic properties of the aquifer, specifically the lateral hydraulic conductivity, or its depth integral, transmissivity. The amount of water stored depends on recharge, the vertical movement of water through unsaturated soils from the surface into the shallow groundwater. The rate of recharge is determined by the supply of water above. This is a function of whether surface water input is retained in the soil zone where it is taken up by plant roots and becomes evapotranspiration, or whether it infiltrates beyond the root zone and percolates to aquifers. These processes depend on the properties of the soils, such as porosity, field capacity, and hydraulic conductivity. The representation of the hydrologic processes of recharge and drainage to baseflow on a drainage scale is done using estimates based on measured data at point locations, as well as soil texture information. As more data is collected, information about subsurface processes can be incorporated into the model representation.\r\n\r\nFor the Lower Nooksack Water Budget soils parameters, soils data was compiled from both local and federal datasets. Using data available from the Natural Resource Conversation Service (NRCS \u2013 formerly the Soil Conservation Service) soils databases (NRCS; SSURGO and STATSGO (www.soilsdatamart.gov)), we have used estimates of averaged soils parameter values over each drainage area as data inputs for the hydrology model compiled in previous work (Tarboton, 2007). These soil parameters include plant available soil moisture, soil depth, hydraulic conductivity, and wetting front suction. Earlier calibrations of Topnet-WM showed that the most sensitive and therefore important soil parameters controlling baseflow movement are saturated soil store sensitivity (f) and soil profile lateral conductivity or transmissivity (To). The Lower Nooksack transmissivity parameters were derived from aquifer hydraulic conductivity values for specific wells, completed within shallow near surface aquifers, as described in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Lynden-Everson-Nooksack-Sumas (LENS) Study (Cox and Kahle, 1999). Although the variability in well data is high given the heterogeneity of glacial and alluvial deposits, interpolating available well data to derive drainage average values captures the drainage level heterogeneity. Here changes in average depth to water table described in the Department of Ecology Study, Nooksack Watershed Surficial Aquifer Characterization (Tooley and Erickson, 1996), were used. Water movement through the surficial aquifer is assumed to decrease exponentially as the depth to the water table increases based on the Topmodel algorithm (Beven, et al., 1995a).\r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget (LNWB) Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch06 Soil Processes and Inputs. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Lindsay, Charles. creator is Gill, Peter. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Lindsay, Charles. creator is Gill, Peter. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Tarboton, David. contributor is Greenberg, Joanne. subject is Soil processes. subject is model inputs for soil. subject is WRIA1. subject is Bertrand Creek. subject is Fishtrap Creek. subject is Soil surface parameters. subject is soil subsurface parameters. subject is STATSGO datasets. organization is University of Washington. organization is Associated Earth Sciences, Inc.. organization is Whatcom County Public Works. availability is public. coverage_type is box. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/bb01915e95234f35b296d780efeacefd/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/23d4cdfd020b4d839bffedde6cf24c85/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/497aea7c3b614e61a61ca808c32d55a2/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Phuong, Jimmy.

 u'Green roofs were designed by civil engineers to insulate buildings, protect buildings from ultraviolet light, and slow stormwater runoff. However, from a biologist\u2019s perspective they are an untapped resource for growing crops and native plants that support pollinators. Two basic assumptions about green roofs are (1) that they provide more habitat for invertebrates than normal roofs, and (2) that approach the same level of biodiversity as ground level sites. The first assumption is so basic that it has rarely been tested. We compared biodiversity on a green roof composed of plants from a commonly used genus in the green roof industry, sedums, with biodiversity on an asphalt tile roof. To test the second assumption we compared biodiversity on a green roof of plants that contained a mix of native and nonnative plants to ground level sites in the immediate vicinity. Surprisingly, invertebrate biodiversity on a sedum roof was not different from that of an asphalt tile roof containing no vegetation. Biodiversity on the mixed native plant green roof did, however, approach similar levels of biodiversity to nearby ground level sites. We conclude that for green roofs to be functional from both engineering and biological perspectives, they must include a diverse array of plants. We are now testing a variety of native plants from Utah to determine their suitability for green roof installations. The data are limited to 2014 and include two separate sites: the greenroof-asphalt roof paired sites at Southern Utah University in Cedar City, Iron County, Utah, and the greenroof-ground level paired sites at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah.title is Green roof invertebrate biodiversity. creator is Grant, Jacqualine. creator is Feng, Youcan. creator is Wallace, Hailey M.. creator is Burian, Steven. creator is Weeg, Matthew S.. author is Grant, Jacqualine. creator is Grant, Jacqualine. creator is Feng, Youcan. creator is Wallace, Hailey M.. creator is Burian, Steven. creator is Weeg, Matthew S.. contributor is Carter, Logan. contributor is Taylor, Chad. contributor is Carlson, Andrew. contributor is Mckittrick, Jordan. contributor is Wilkinson, James. subject is insects. subject is taxonomy. subject is pollinator. subject is private. subject is isopods. subject is spiders. subject is invertebrates. subject is Salt Lake County. subject is green infrastructure. subject is Iron County. subject is iUTAH. organization is Southern Utah University. organization is University of Utah. organization is Southern Utah University. availability is private. coverage_type is box. coverage_type is period. format is text/csv. format is text/plain. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Iutah Data manager. owner is Grant, Jacqualine. extra is Observed Variables: date, location, specimen order, specimen family, specimen genus, specimen species. extra is Variable Description: various diversity measures. extra is Data Processing Method: Specimens identified to order, family, genus, or species with key to insects.. extra is Data Collection Method: Invertebrates collected weekly with combination traps..

 u'This resource contains the results of a 13C-hemicellulose DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) experiment that tested how nutrients and light exposure influence hemicellulose decomposition and hemicellulose-degrading bacterial populations. We conducted our experiment with stream biofilms grown on nutrient diffusing substrates (NDS) in the Middle Provo River (Utah), at a site below Jordanelle Reservoir (June 1, 2016 - June 20, 2016). To construct the nutrient diffusing substrates, we filled 1-oz plastic cups with unamended agar and then capped the agar with a fritted glass disc, which served as a platform for biofilm colonization. To assess potential nutrient limitation of the stream biofilms grown for our hemicellulose DNA-SIP experiment, we also deployed NDS containing agar amended with either no nutrients (control), nitrogen (N; 0.5 M NH4-N), phosphorus (P; 0.5 M PO4-P), or N and P (N+P) and measured biomass (chlorophyll a, ash-free dry mass) and calculated Autotrophic Index values.  The CSV file \u201chemicellulose DNA-SIP nutrient limitation\u201d contains summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, count) of chlorophyll, ash-free dry mass, and Autotrophic Index values on each nutrient treatment.  The Word document \u201chemicellulose DNA-SIP analytical methods\u201d describes the analytical methods used to measure chlorophyll and ash-free dry mass.  To characterize conditions at the site, we collected water column samples for total and dissolved nutrient analyses and calculated degree days from time series water temperature data collected as part of the NSF-funded iUTAH project (Award number 1208732).  The CSV file \u201chemicellulose DNA-SIP site characteristics\u201d reports degree days and water column concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N + NO2-N), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP-P) (nutrient concentrations are mean of 3 replicates).  The Word document \u201chemicellulose DNA-SIP analytical methods\u201d describes the analytical methods used to measure nutrient concentrations.\r\n\r\nBiofilms grown on unamended NDS were used to perform the hemicellulose DNA-SIP experiment.  Biofilm-colonized discs were placed in clear glass jars containing filter-sterilized river water amended with 13C-hemicellulose (approximately 540 \xb5mol C L-1). We tested eight combinations of nutrient (control, N, P, N+P) and light exposure (light, dark) treatments. Nutrient treatments were applied by adding N (2.5 mg NH4-N L-1) and/or P (0.36 mg PO4-P L-1) to the appropriate jars. To apply the light exposure treatments, we wrapped dark treatment jars in aluminum foil and left the light treatment jars unwrapped.  We incubated jars for 10 days on a shaker table (50 rpm) in a growth chamber held at a temperature of 12\xb0C set to a 15-hour photoperiod, which was illuminated using cool white fluorescent bulbs (4200 K color temperature, Sylvania Supersaver, Osram Sylvania Products Inc.). The average photosynthetically active radiation, measured with a LI-COR LI-190 quantum sensor, was 27.3 \xb5E m-2 sec-1.  We collected biofilms and water samples from each treatment on day 0 and day 10. Biofilms were frozen for DNA-SIP analyses. Water samples were collected for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence characterization analyses.  We used DOC and DOM data to calculate Fluorescence Index (FI), Freshness Index (BIX), Humification Index (HIX) and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA254; calculated by dividing the absorbance at 254 nm by the DOC concentration).  The CSV file \u201chemicellulose DNA-SIP DOC and DOM\u201d contains summary statistics of DOC and DOM data in each hemicellulose incubation treatment.  The Word document \u201chemicellulose DNA-SIP analytical methods\u201d describes the analytical methods used to measure DOC and DOM.\r\n\r\nDNA-SIP analyses were conducted by first extracting genomic DNA from each biofilm-colonized disc.  We next separated the DNA in each sample by density using ultracentrifugation (58,000 rpm, 20\xb0C, at least 72 hours).  We collected 28 density fractions from the resulting gradient with a fraction recovery system and pooled the low density fractions containing unlabeled DNA and high density fractions containing 13C labeled DNA in each sample.  We then composited the low and high density fractions from all samples within each hemicellulose incubation treatment. We performed target metagenomics of the 16S rRNA gene, analyzed the sequences using Mothur (Schloss et al. 2009), identified operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using Megablast at a minimum coverage of 99% and minimum pairwise identity of 97%, and aligned the phylogenetic identities against the SILVA database (Glockner et al. 2017).  The CSV file \u201chemicellulose DNA-SIP shared OTU\u201d lists the number of sequences for each OTU in the low and high density fractions of each hemicellulose incubation treatment.

 u'The Lower Nooksack Subbasin is comprised of a variety of land and water uses both agricultural and nonagricultural. The water uses, described in this chapter include municipal, industrial, residential, and commercial. The following analysis of nonagricultural water use is divided into three sections: municipal/industrial, residential, and commercial/industrial.\r\n\r\nThe utilities that serve municipal/industrial customers in the Lower Nooksack Subbasin include the City of Bellingham, the City of Everson, the City of Ferndale, the City of Lynden, and the PUD #1 of Whatcom County. For these utilities, large municipal user water system records were obtained for years 2007 through 2011. Averages for this five year period were used in the model for water use, return flows, and interbasin transfers. The average annual diversion by the large utilities municipalities in our analysis totals nearly 25 cfs, 82% of which are transferred out of the Nooksack basin. The majority of that water serves Cherry Point industries; a small amount serves out-of-basin irrigators.\r\n\r\nResidential, or domestic, water use was estimated according to population. Population and per capita water use rates are the foundation for calculating an average daily residential water use for each drainage in the Lower Nooksack Subbasin. 2010 Census geospatial census data were used to calculate the population for each drainage. The 2010 population for the Lower Nooksack Subbasin was 46,204, up 8,345 since the 2000 census. A per capita demand rate of 88 gallons per capita per day was agreed upon by the WRIA 1 Joint Board Staff Team to use as input along with the new population numbers. Seasonal demand factors were also determined to distribute monthly water use such that maximum demand occurred in the summer months and minimum demand in the winter.\r\n\r\nBusinesses and other operations that are not supplied water by a municipality are either served by a smaller public water system or are self-supplied. For commercial users not within the service area of the municipalities listed above, water use was estimated based on average use rates agreed on in 2003 with the WRIA 1 Water Quantity Technical Team. Commercial use was based on the type of operation identified in the Whatcom County Assessor records. \r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the LNWB Ch08 Water Management - industrial, residential, and commercial water use Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch08 Water Management - industrial, residential, and commercial water use - data. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. author is Greenberg, Joanne. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Ignac, Kasey. contributor is Tarboton, David. contributor is Gill, Peter. contributor is Bandaragoda, Christina. subject is model parameter inputs. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Phuong, Jimmy. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u'Overview: \r\nArtificial drainage is used throughout WRIA 1 to aid in the flow of water on top of or through the soil, sometimes to slow it down, other times to direct it to a specific location at any given depth of the landscape. Some of these systems are critical to the farm operations that make Whatcom County one of Washington\u2019s top agricultural producers, others help riverside and lowland communities alleviate the impacts of high flowing rivers and streams. In high precipitation events, increased numbers of flow pathways provided by artificial drains may increase the peak stormwater quantities and contribute to flood impacts. Some artificial drains may even offer opportunities to improve low instream flows in the late season. \r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nThe model feature that represents artificial drainage has been incorporated into WRIA 1 Topnet Water Management (Topnet-WM) because of the assumption that agricultural drainage installed during development of agriculture in WRIA 1 has altered the runoff processes to a large enough degree that these alterations should be part of the simulation. Calculating how the ditches and tiles influence the drainage of the soils was done based on a drainage coefficient from NRCS technical guides. The Lower Nooksack Water Budget project team used previously existing (2007 Topnet-WM model) compiled information, data and maps of the many ditches and tile drains that exist in the Lower Nooksack study area in order to develop the artificial drainage inputs for the 2012 work conducted on the Lower Nooksack Water Budget. \r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget (LNWB) Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch09 Artificial Drainage. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Tarboton, David. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Tarboton, David. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Renner, Dean. contributor is Freimund, Jeremy. contributor is Gill, Peter. contributor is Gillies, John. subject is drainage coefficients. subject is drain map. subject is Artificial Drainage Model. subject is Artificial drainage shape files. subject is Artificial drainage geodatabase. organization is University of Washington. organization is Utah State University. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. availability is public. coverage_type is box. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/256a03118d224d638f53eb68f72955e7/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/d3a67c0472e24f6eb6d94fc300171f8a/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/ce14d387eda44cd7bb2080f103e42daa/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/83c33f7549124314bdae7a276e93789d/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/e503a8232c0246f2a645640d49329454/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/33073c9cab81419f935372f5f2b63f06/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/cc60057586454d80b6f8e9e2308a31ed/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/5216cc9b318445fba97cd7008c1ea0af/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Phuong, Jimmy.

 u'Correspondence between David Tarboton and Becky Peterson on drainage procedures, and two memos describing PhaseIII Task4 work.\r\n\r\nWithin the Rainfall-Runoff Transformation of Topnet-WM there are five subcomponents: canopy interception store, vadose zone soil store, groundwater saturated zone, channel flow, and artificial drainage. Surface water input to the canopy interception store comprises rainfall and snow as well as sprinkler irrigation. Throughfall is computed based upon the canopy interception capacity, surface water input, and water in canopy storage and is taken as input to the vadose zone soil store. Potential evapotranspiration not satisfied from the interception store becomes potential evapotranspiration from the vadose zone soil store. Drip irrigation is also an input to the vadose zone soil store. Based on the input and storage in the vadose zone soil storage, recharge to groundwater and surface runoff is calculated. The vadose zone soil storage is depleted for areas with artificial drainage, representing ditch and tile drains that remove water directly from the vadose zone soil storage to stream channels. The vadose zone soil store calculation also accounts for potential upwelling from groundwater where the water table is shallow. The groundwater saturated zone calculations account for recharge, upwelling and groundwater pumping and produce baseflow as an output. Baseflow and surface runoff from the vadose zone soil store are combined to calculate channel flow. \r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the LNWB Ch09 Artificial Drainage Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch09 Artificial Drainage - Procedures. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Tarboton, David. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Tarboton, David. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Renner, Dean. contributor is Freimund, Jeremy. contributor is Gill, Peter. contributor is Gillies, John. subject is Artificial Drainage Model. organization is University of Washington. organization is Utah State University. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. availability is public. format is application/msword. format is application/zip. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Phuong, Jimmy. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u'Overview:\r\nStreamflow is part of the dynamic hydrologic system that supports a range of water dependent activities in Whatcom County, including farming, fishing and recreation. The relationship between streamflow, groundwater recharge and groundwater discharge, precipitation, fish habitat and crop production is critical for understanding how best to manage water to meet those needs. Streamflow is the best characterized, and most easily measured, component of the dynamic hydrologic system, and as such, is the primary metric used in modeling the water budget. For example, facilitating development of water management options that improve streamflow in the late summer is one of the reasons for developing the Lower Nooksack Water Budget.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Nooksack Water Budget project included a review of available streamflow measurements made available since WRIA 1 Water Management Project Phase III Task 1 (2002). For the streamflow database update (Lower Nooksack Water Budget Project, Task 2), the project team compiled available information, data, and maps of the stream data collected in the Lower Nooksack study area, as well as WRIA 1 upstream boundary conditions, and updated the database of measured streamflow from 1999 to 2011. The updated streamflow database will be used to calibrate and validate the Topnet-WM hydrologic model, and to calculate water budgets for each of the Lower Nooksack drainages; data will be available in an ASCII format for all other drainages but will not be formally summarized.\r\n\r\nThe following section begins with the list of streamflow gages in WRIA 1, followed by an explanation of how the data were used for model inputs. This information was used along with other Lower Nooksack Water Budget technical components to calculate the hydrologic model outputs working with the WRIA 1 Joint Board\u2019s existing hydrologic model and supporting technical tools. \r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget (LNWB) Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch10 Stream Flow. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Doremus, Llyn. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Doremus, Llyn. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Mariza Costa-Cabral. contributor is Freimund, Jeremy. contributor is Gill, Peter. contributor is Capen, Bracken. subject is Observed data. subject is boundary flow relationships. subject is regression outputs. subject is stream flow data. subject is stream flow model processes. subject is stream flow database. organization is University of Washington. organization is Washington State Department of Ecology. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. availability is public. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/fc69b708427a42a0b0994bc6a748b249/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/ba69c0a28b5640e6ac18fe33a00c4011/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/972094e5e7344f088820df9e9cc153a1/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/eadbfbadca1444d8af7c916cec299cdc/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Phuong, Jimmy.

 u'Overview:\r\nThe Lower Nooksack Water Budget is calculated using a numerical simulation model called Topnet-WM. This hydrologic model uses data distributed in space and time to determine the flow of water between various locations and points in time on a daily time step. The modeling of the watershed is limited by the representation of hydrologic processes built into the model, the spatial data used to parameterize the model, and the climate time series data which provides the daily water inputs to the model. To address the limits of our data and knowledge of the system, parameters are used to control the relationships among hydrologic processes and the data used to represent them. In model calibration, parameters are changed within a range of expected values so that the model representation results in modeled streamflow that closely matches observed streamflow. The calibration parameters used include: saturated soil store sensitivity, hydraulic conductivity, overland flow velocity, transmissivity, and impervious surface fraction. The saturated soil store sensitivity, or f parameter, is the most sensitive parameter in this model. It is a measure of the sensitivity of lateral groundwater flow to changes in groundwater level.\r\n\r\nThe process of model calibration is complex because of limitations in models, input and output data, mathematical structure of the models, and quantitative methods used to fit the model to the data, as well as imperfect knowledge of basin characteristics (Schaake, 2003). In a world of perfect understanding of hydrologic processes, perfect input data, and no scale discrepancy between modeled and measured data, it might be possible to avoid hydrologic model calibration. An important result from the National Weather Service Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP; Smith et al., 2004a) experiment was the acknowledgement that uncalibrated models do not have the benefit of accounting for the known biases in the rainfall archives over the calibration period. Only in the absence of precipitation and other data input biases, might uncalibrated models be able to outperform calibrated models (Reed et al., 2004). Errors in input data cannot be ignored (Gupta et al., 1998), and therefore model calibration cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\nPast work by the Lower Nooksack Water Budget Project Team has examined ways to improve the use of streamflow data that are available within a watershed and that can be used for model calibration, especially to improve the model performance where streamflow data are not available (Bandaragoda et al., 2004; Bandaragoda, 2007; Bandaragoda and Greenberg, 2009; Bandaragoda, 2008; Bandaragoda and Nielson, 2011, Neilson et al., 2010, Tarboton, 2007). The primary calibration locations in this project focused on Fishtrap Creek, Bertrand Creek and Tenmile Creek, with verification at Nooksack River locations at Cedarville and Ferndale.\r\n\r\nIn hydrologic model calibration, streamflow prediction statistics can be used as a measure of model performance, but the calibration must also address issues relevant to understanding the heterogeneity of the hydrologic system and the unique locations that are modeled. Implemented carefully, automatic calibration techniques that employ multiple objectives and estimates of distributions of watershed parameters may be a step towards both improving models and understanding hydrologic processes. \r\n\r\nAs calibration is used to conduct diagnostic model analysis and interactive learning about watersheds, our understanding of how to best model the movement of water can increase, and lead to an improvement in our existing models. As the existing models develop, the reliance on calibration will decrease, development of new models will increase, and our predictions of streamflow will improve. \r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget (LNWB) Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch11 Model Calibration. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Tarboton, David. contributor is Freimund, Jeremy. contributor is Greenberg, Joanne. contributor is Gill, Peter. subject is calibration outputs. subject is calibration scripts. subject is calibration data sets. organization is University of Washington. availability is public. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is Lower Nooksack Water Budget. relation is Lower Nooksack Water Budget. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/6b642d6ede9f4b289ae1adb4be48a022/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/59b285eebd924a469c17e5a94b82aa2c/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/278691f0a3574a86abb3adf0543a0df8/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Phuong, Jimmy.

 u'Overview:\r\nThe availability of updated climate data, streamflow data, updated water use estimates and the incorporation of the Topnet Water Management (Topnet-WM) components provides the opportunity to build watershed knowledge by better understanding the climate, watershed hydrology and water budget. \r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nThe Lower Nooksack Water Budget project analysis focused on the 16 drainages of the Lower Nooksack Subbasin and for each drainage considers precipitation, evapotranspiration, storage, streamflow and user withdrawals. Storage includes canopy storage, unsaturated soil storage, and subsurface storage. Total streamflow includes baseflow, surface runoff, and artificial drainage. User withdrawals include irrigation, dairy, municipal/industrial water supply, and residential and commercial water use served by small public water systems or private wells. The sum of user withdrawals for each drainage is partitioned into groundwater and surface water withdrawals. In addition to streamflow prediction at each drainage, streamflow is calculated at multiple locations of interest (nodes) within each drainage. Total streamflow at nodes is partitioned into surface runoff and baseflow.\r\n\r\nModel calculations are conducted on a daily timestep from 1952-2011. In future work, further summaries of daily information and other various components can be done at multiple time scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, annual) and multiple spatial scales (WRIA 1, Upper or Lower Nooksack, individual drainage).\r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the LNWB Ch12-13 Existing and Historic Model Outputs Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch12-13 Existing and Historic Model Outputs - data. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. creator is Dumas, Mary. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. creator is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Lindsay, Charles. contributor is Tarboton, David. contributor is Gill, Peter. subject is Existing and Historic Conditions. subject is calibration data sets. organization is University of Washington. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. organization is Dumas & Associates. availability is public. format is application/zip. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. format is application/vnd.ms-excel.sheet.macroEnabled.12. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Phuong, Jimmy. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u'Overview:\r\nAgricultural water use includes the irrigation of croplands and the water needs of dairy farms. Irrigated agriculture is an important component of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget due to the high demand for water during the relatively dry summer seasons. Along with out-of-basin industrial water use, irrigation is the largest use of water in the Lower Nooksack Subbasin and has a commensurate effect on the water budget. The highest demand for irrigation water occurs during the month of July when streamflows are low. Dairy water use equals the amount of water the cows drink plus the water used for washdown. The dairy demand is small relative to irrigation.\r\n\r\nSince measured diversion or withdrawal records are not available, an estimate of crop irrigation requirements was developed using an empirically derived calculation of water demand. Drainage-wide irrigation estimates are based on the acres irrigated, type of crop, method of irrigation, and soil types.\r\n\r\nRecent crop data from Washington Department of Agriculture and previous studies are summarized by surface water drainage area. The U.S. portion of the Lower Nooksack Subbasin contains approximately 54,044 acres of which 28,140 acres are irrigated or approximately 80% of the countywide irrigation total. Major crops include grass hay, pastureland, field corn, raspberries, and potatoes which comprise 97% of the crops grown in the Subbasin.\r\n\r\nWithin the 16 Lower Nooksack Subbasin drainages, the irrigated agriculture areas have the highest percent of total drainage area in Scott, Fourmile, Kamm, and Wiser Lake/Cougar Creek. Bertrand and Fishtrap Creek percentages include the irrigated area on both the US and Canadian sides. By volume alone, Bertrand and Fishtrap Creek drainages use the highest amount of irrigation water. Irrigation water use rates for each drainage can be found in Chapter 11 Existing Scenario, Water Budget Model Outputs for Lower Nooksack Drainages.\r\n\r\nCrop evapotranspiration is an integral component of the hydrologic cycle and is calculated internally in the Topnet Water Management (Topnet-WM) model. The Topnet model uses the Penman Monteith method (adopted and standardized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (2005)) for calculating evapotranspiration of a reference crop [ETr] (short cut grass or tall alfalfa). Tall alfalfa is the reference crop integrated in the WRIA 1 Topnet model. The difference between potential and actual evapotranspiration is the amount of crop water demand that must be satisfied by irrigation.\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nThis section defines the model inputs necessary for calculating the irrigation demand outputs. Results summarizing the irrigation demand on a monthly basis can be found in Chapter 11 Existing Conditions, Water Budget Model Outputs for Lower Nooksack Drainages.\r\n\r\nCrop evapotranspiration is an integral component of the hydrologic cycle and is calculated, along with the other components of the water budget. The inputs defined in this chapter include crop type, number of acres, monthly crop coefficients, type of irrigation application (drip or spray) and irrigation efficiencies. Inputs were developed for the 16 Lower Nooksack Subbasin drainages only.\r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the LNWB Ch07 Water Management - Agricultural water use Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch07 Water Management - Agricultural water use - data. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Lutz, Samya. contributor is Freimund, Jeremy. contributor is Gill, Peter. contributor is Ignac, Kasey. subject is agricultural water use data. subject is crop coefficients. subject is lower nooksack subbasin. organization is University of Washington. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. availability is public. format is text/plain. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Phuong, Jimmy. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u'Overview:\r\nTopnet-WM refers to the Water Management version of Topnet developed as a work product for the Utah State University WRIA 1 Watershed Management Project (Tarboton, 2007). This version of the model evolved from the Topnet Model developed in a collaboration between NIWA New Zealand and Utah State University (Bandaragoda et al., 2004; Ibbitt and Woods, 2004) that combines TOPMODEL concepts (Beven and Kirkby, 1979; Beven et al., 1995a) for the simulation of relatively small drainages combined with channel routing. This approach provides a modeling system that can be applied over large watersheds using smaller drainages within the large watershed as model elements.\r\n\r\nIn Topnet-WM, spatial variability is represented by subdividing the watershed domain into model elements at the scale of drainages. Within drainages, the modeling is essentially lumped but includes parameterization of some subgrid variability, notably (1) the wetness index, used to parameterize the variability of soil moisture, (2) a depletion curve, used to parameterize the variability of snow water equivalent, (3) the fraction of area that is irrigated, and (4) areas with artificial drainage. Surface runoff and baseflow can be designated as model outputs at multiple nodes within a drainage. The model may thus be classified as semi-distributed.\r\n\r\nTopnet-WM includes many enhancements beyond the original Beven and Kirkby TOPMODEL, such as: (1) calculation of reference evapotranspiration using the ASCE standardized Penman-Monteith method (Allen et al., 2005; Jensen et al., 1990); (2) calculation of snowmelt using the Utah Energy Balance Snowmelt model (Tarboton et al., 1995a); (3) the partition of model elements into separate components representing irrigated and non-irrigated areas; (4) artificial drainage to represent the effect of ditch and tile drained areas on the runoff response; (5) the partition of the model elements into pervious and impervious areas to allow representation of urbanization; (6) options for the diversion and storage of water under different management options; and (7) components to calculate water use and implement water right rules.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Nooksack Water Budget will be estimated based on the distributed hydrologic model, Topnet-WM. The Lower Nooksack Water Budget included updating the data inputs and model calibration, which requires a thorough understanding of how the model represents physical hydrologic processes. In order to guide the development of model inputs and analysis of model outputs, the project team has edited and reviewed portions of the WRIA 1 Water Management Project Phase III Task 4.1 report (Tarboton, 2007) to include in the general description of the Topnet-WM model that follows. This chapter provides reference to the details of the model processes used by Topnet-WM to convert data inputs into model outputs.\r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget (LNWB) Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch02 Model Processes. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Tarboton, David. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Tarboton, David. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Mariza Costa-Cabral. contributor is Freimund, Jeremy. contributor is Gill, Peter. contributor is Greenberg, Joanne. subject is hydrologic model. organization is University of Washington. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/d36dd0975ee848758471d4612feb559e/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Phuong, Jimmy.

 u'Overview:\r\nThe Lower Nooksack Water Budget Project involved assembling a wide range of existing data related to WRIA 1 and specifically the Lower Nooksack Subbasin, updating existing data sets and generating new data sets. This Data Management Plan provides an overview of the data sets, formats and collaboration environment that was used to develop the project. Use of a plan during development of the technical work products provided a forum for the data development and management to be conducted with transparent methods and processes. At project completion, the Data Management Plan provides an accessible archive of the data resources used and supporting information on the data storage, intended access, sharing and re-use guidelines. \r\n\r\nOne goal of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget project is to make this \u201cusable technical information\u201d as accessible as possible across technical, policy and general public users. The project data, analyses and documents will be made available through the WRIA 1 Watershed Management Project website http://wria1project.org. This information is intended for use by the WRIA 1 Joint Board and partners working to achieve the adopted goals and priorities of the WRIA 1 Watershed Management Plan. \r\n\r\nModel outputs for the Lower Nooksack Water Budget are summarized by sub-watersheds (drainages) and point locations (nodes). In general, due to changes in land use over time and changes to available streamflow and climate data, the water budget for any watershed needs to be updated periodically. Further detailed information about data sources is provided in review packets developed for specific technical components including climate, streamflow and groundwater level, soils and land cover, and water use.\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nThis project involves assembling a wide range of existing data related to the WRIA 1 and specifically the Lower Nooksack Subbasin, updating existing data sets and generating new data sets. Data will be used as input to various hydrologic, climatic and geomorphic components of the Topnet-Water Management (WM) model, but will also be available to support other modeling efforts in WRIA 1. Much of the data used as input to the Topnet model is publicly available and maintained by others, (i.e., USGS DEMs and streamflow data, SSURGO soils data, University of Washington gridded meteorological data). Pre-processing is performed to convert these existing data into a format that can be used as input to the Topnet model. Post-processing of Topnet model ASCII-text file outputs is subsequently combined with spatial data to generate GIS data that can be used to create maps and illustrations of the spatial distribution of water information. Other products generated during this project will include documentation of methods, input by WRIA 1 Joint Board Staff Team during review and comment periods, communication tools developed for public engagement and public comment on the project.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain an organized system of developing and distributing data, Lower Nooksack Water Budget project collaborators should be familiar with standards for data management described in this document, and the following issues related to generating and distributing data:\r\n1. Standards for metadata and data formats\r\n2. Plans for short-term storage and data management (i.e., file formats, local storage and back up procedures and security)\r\n3. Legal and ethical issues (i.e., intellectual property, confidentiality of study participants)\r\n4. Access policies and provisions (i.e., how the data will be made available to others, any restrictions needed)\r\n5. Provisions for long-term archiving and preservation (i.e., establishment of a new data archive or utilization of an existing archive)\r\n6.

 u'Overview:\r\nAgricultural water use includes the irrigation of croplands and the water needs of dairy farms. Irrigated agriculture is an important component of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget due to the high demand for water during the relatively dry summer seasons. Along with out-of-basin industrial water use, irrigation is the largest use of water in the Lower Nooksack Subbasin and has a commensurate effect on the water budget. The highest demand for irrigation water occurs during the month of July when streamflows are low. Dairy water use equals the amount of water the cows drink plus the water used for washdown. The dairy demand is small relative to irrigation.\r\n\r\nSince measured diversion or withdrawal records are not available, an estimate of crop irrigation requirements was developed using an empirically derived calculation of water demand. Drainage-wide irrigation estimates are based on the acres irrigated, type of crop, method of irrigation, and soil types.\r\n\r\nRecent crop data from Washington Department of Agriculture and previous studies are summarized by surface water drainage area. The U.S. portion of the Lower Nooksack Subbasin contains approximately 54,044 acres of which 28,140 acres are irrigated or approximately 80% of the countywide irrigation total. Major crops include grass hay, pastureland, field corn, raspberries, and potatoes which comprise 97% of the crops grown in the Subbasin.\r\n\r\nWithin the 16 Lower Nooksack Subbasin drainages, the irrigated agriculture areas have the highest percent of total drainage area in Scott, Fourmile, Kamm, and Wiser Lake/Cougar Creek. Bertrand and Fishtrap Creek percentages include the irrigated area on both the US and Canadian sides. By volume alone, Bertrand and Fishtrap Creek drainages use the highest amount of irrigation water. Irrigation water use rates for each drainage can be found in Chapter 11 Existing Scenario, Water Budget Model Outputs for Lower Nooksack Drainages.\r\n\r\nCrop evapotranspiration is an integral component of the hydrologic cycle and is calculated internally in the Topnet Water Management (Topnet-WM) model. The Topnet model uses the Penman Monteith method (adopted and standardized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (2005)) for calculating evapotranspiration of a reference crop [ETr] (short cut grass or tall alfalfa). Tall alfalfa is the reference crop integrated in the WRIA 1 Topnet model. The difference between potential and actual evapotranspiration is the amount of crop water demand that must be satisfied by irrigation.\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nThis section defines the model inputs necessary for calculating the irrigation demand outputs. Results summarizing the irrigation demand on a monthly basis can be found in Chapter 11 Existing Conditions, Water Budget Model Outputs for Lower Nooksack Drainages.\r\n\r\nCrop evapotranspiration is an integral component of the hydrologic cycle and is calculated, along with the other components of the water budget. The inputs defined in this chapter include crop type, number of acres, monthly crop coefficients, type of irrigation application (drip or spray) and irrigation efficiencies. Inputs were developed for the 16 Lower Nooksack Subbasin drainages only.\r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget (LNWB) Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch07 Water Management - Agricultural water use. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Lutz, Samya. contributor is Freimund, Jeremy. contributor is Gill, Peter. contributor is Ignac, Kasey. subject is agricultural water use data. subject is crop coefficients. subject is lower nooksack subbasin. organization is University of Washington. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. availability is public. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/8f361f21f9884c4b883a7b9d723155bc/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Phuong, Jimmy.

 u'The Lower Nooksack Subbasin is comprised of a variety of land and water uses both agricultural and nonagricultural. The water uses, described in this chapter include municipal, industrial, residential, and commercial. The following analysis of nonagricultural water use is divided into three sections: municipal/industrial, residential, and commercial/industrial.\r\n\r\nThe utilities that serve municipal/industrial customers in the Lower Nooksack Subbasin include the City of Bellingham, the City of Everson, the City of Ferndale, the City of Lynden, and the PUD #1 of Whatcom County. For these utilities, large municipal user water system records were obtained for years 2007 through 2011. Averages for this five year period were used in the model for water use, return flows, and interbasin transfers. The average annual diversion by the large utilities municipalities in our analysis totals nearly 25 cfs, 82% of which are transferred out of the Nooksack basin. The majority of that water serves Cherry Point industries; a small amount serves out-of-basin irrigators.\r\n\r\nResidential, or domestic, water use was estimated according to population. Population and per capita water use rates are the foundation for calculating an average daily residential water use for each drainage in the Lower Nooksack Subbasin. 2010 Census geospatial census data were used to calculate the population for each drainage. The 2010 population for the Lower Nooksack Subbasin was 46,204, up 8,345 since the 2000 census. A per capita demand rate of 88 gallons per capita per day was agreed upon by the WRIA 1 Joint Board Staff Team to use as input along with the new population numbers. Seasonal demand factors were also determined to distribute monthly water use such that maximum demand occurred in the summer months and minimum demand in the winter.\r\n\r\nBusinesses and other operations that are not supplied water by a municipality are either served by a smaller public water system or are self-supplied. For commercial users not within the service area of the municipalities listed above, water use was estimated based on average use rates agreed on in 2003 with the WRIA 1 Water Quantity Technical Team. Commercial use was based on the type of operation identified in the Whatcom County Assessor records. \r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget (LNWB) Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch8 Water Management - industrial, residential, and commercial water use. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. author is Greenberg, Joanne. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. contributor is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Ignac, Kasey. contributor is Tarboton, David. contributor is Gill, Peter. contributor is Bandaragoda, Christina. subject is model parameter inputs. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. availability is public. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/978ad72af2d248febfc7eb6342a6b436/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Phuong, Jimmy.

 u'Overview:\r\nThe availability of updated climate data, streamflow data, updated water use estimates and the incorporation of the Topnet Water Management (Topnet-WM) components provides the opportunity to build watershed knowledge by better understanding the climate, watershed hydrology and water budget. \r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nThe Lower Nooksack Water Budget project analysis focused on the 16 drainages of the Lower Nooksack Subbasin and for each drainage considers precipitation, evapotranspiration, storage, streamflow and user withdrawals. Storage includes canopy storage, unsaturated soil storage, and subsurface storage. Total streamflow includes baseflow, surface runoff, and artificial drainage. User withdrawals include irrigation, dairy, municipal/industrial water supply, and residential and commercial water use served by small public water systems or private wells. The sum of user withdrawals for each drainage is partitioned into groundwater and surface water withdrawals. In addition to streamflow prediction at each drainage, streamflow is calculated at multiple locations of interest (nodes) within each drainage. Total streamflow at nodes is partitioned into surface runoff and baseflow.\r\n\r\nModel calculations are conducted on a daily timestep from 1952-2011. In future work, further summaries of daily information and other various components can be done at multiple time scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, annual) and multiple spatial scales (WRIA 1, Upper or Lower Nooksack, individual drainage).\r\n\r\nThis resource is a subset of the Lower Nooksack Water Budget (LNWB) Collection Resource.title is LNWB Ch12-13 Existing and Historic Model Outputs. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. creator is Dumas, Mary. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Greenberg, Joanne. creator is Dumas, Mary. contributor is Lindsay, Charles. contributor is Tarboton, David. contributor is Gill, Peter. subject is Existing and Historic Conditions. organization is University of Washington. organization is HydroLogic Services Co.. organization is Dumas & Associates. availability is public. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/07c1b92dbc844234b9d9a3050cef3c4b/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Phuong, Jimmy.

 u'This demo illustrates how you would set up and solve an optimization problem (constrained non-linear minimization).\r\n\r\nThe problem is to determine the locations of # cell towers, each having various coverage radius, so that there is maximum coverage, or minimum overlap. It is a constrained optimization problem because the cell towers are constrained to lie within a boundary. It is a non-linear optimization problem because of the non-linear objective function (overlap area as a function of # cell tower locations).\r\n\r\nThe demo is designed to show the key steps in setting up and solving an optimization problem. The details of the problem can be omitted by using predefined objective and plotting functions.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.mathworks.com/examples/matlab/community/14723-demo-script-for-cell-tower-optimization-problemtitle is Cell Tower Optimization Script. creator is Ames, Dan. author is Ames, Dan. creator is Ames, Dan. subject is Optimization. subject is Cell Tower. subject is Script. subject is Matlab. organization is Brigham Young University. availability is private. coverage_type is point. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Script Resource. owner is Ames, Dan.

 u'Beaver ponds and beaver-impounded vegetation are indicators of past or present beaver activity that can be detected from aerial photography. A method to quantitatively relate these beaver works with the density of active beaver colonies could benefit beaver management, particularly in areas lacking beaver population data. We compared historical maps (1961\u20132006) of beaver works at Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA with concurrent aerial surveys of beaver colonies. We tested 2 landscape-scale models of beaver colony density previously developed for a period of beaver population expansion (1940\u20131986), but they failed to predict colony density after 1986, a period of declining beaver population.

 u'This resource shows the permanent lakes in the Voyageurs National Park. Beaver ponds and beaver-impounded vegetation are indicators of past or present beaver activity that can be detected from aerial photography. A method to quantitatively relate these beaver works with the density of active beaver colonies could benefit beaver management, particularly in areas lacking beaver population data. We compared historical maps (1961\u20132006) of beaver works at Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA with concurrent aerial surveys of beaver colonies. We tested 2 landscape-scale models of beaver colony density previously developed for a period of beaver population expansion (1940\u20131986), but they failed to predict colony density after 1986, a period of declining beaver population. We developed a new landscape-scale regression, calculating that 2.15% of the landscape would be flooded by every 100 additional beaver colonies (R2 = 0.53, P = 0.027). Classification tree analysis of individual pond sites showed that open water pond and impounded marsh area were the primary predictors of beaver colony presence or absence, but that the classification trees were far better at identifying inactive sites (>93% correct) than active sites (35\u201338% correct).

 u'Over the last decade, model coupling frameworks like CSDMS (Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System) and ESMF (Earth System Modeling Framework) have developed mechanisms that make it much easier for modelers to connect heterogeneous sets of process models  in a plug-and-play manner to create composite "system models".  These mechanisms greatly simplify code reuse, but must simultaneously satisfy many different design criteria.  They must be able to mediate or compensate for differences between the process models, such as their different programming languages, computational grids, time-stepping schemes, variable names and variable units.  However, they must achieve this interoperability in a way that: (1) is noninvasive, requiring only relatively small and isolated changes to the original source code, (2) does not significantly reduce performance, (3) is not time-consuming or confusing for a model developer to implement, (4) can very easily be updated to accommodate new versions of a given process model and (5) does not shift the burden of providing model interoperability to the model developers.\r\n\r\nIn tackling these design challenges, model framework developers have learned that the best solution is to provide each model with a simple, standardized interface, i.e. a set of standardized functions that make the model: (1) fully-controllable by a caller (e.g. a model framework) and (2) self-describing with standardized metadata.  Model control functions are separate functions that allow a caller to initialize the model, advance the model\'s state variables in time and finalize the model.   Model description functions allow a caller to retrieve detailed information on the model\'s input and output variables, its computational grid and its timestepping scheme.  If the caller is a modeling framework, it can use the self description functions to learn about each process model in a collection to be coupled and then automatically call framework service components (e.g. regridders, time interpolators and unit converters) as necessary to mediate the differences between them so they can work together.\r\n\r\nThis talk will first review two key products of the CSDMS project, namely a standardized model interface called the Basic Model Interface (BMI) and the CSDMS Standard Names.  The standard names are used in conjunction with BMI to provide a semantic matching mechanism that allows output variables from one process model or data set to be reliably used as input variables to other process models in a collection.  They include not just a standardized naming scheme for model variables, but also a standardized set of terms for describing the attributes and assumptions of a given model.  Recent efforts to bring powerful uncertainty analysis and inverse modeling toolkits such as DAKOTA into modeling frameworks will also be described. This talk will conclude with an overview of several related modeling projects that have been funded by NSF\'s EarthCube initiative, namely the Earth System Bridge, OntoSoft and GeoSemantics projects.\r\ntitle is Peckham EGU 2016 Talk:  Advances in Geoscience Modeling:  Smart Modeling Frameworks, Self-Describing Models and the Role of Standardized Metadata. creator is Peckham, Scott. author is Peckham, Scott. creator is Peckham, Scott. subject is modeling frameworks. subject is self-describing models. subject is standardized metadata. subject is model metadata. organization is University of Colorado, Boulder. availability is private. format is application/vnd.ms-powerpoint. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Peckham, Scott.

The macroinvertebrates  were collected by surfer sampler and the algae collected by hand and the sampling occurred from June - September, 2015.  The samples were cleaned and prepared within 48 hours for nitrogen and carbon stable isotope analysis in the mass spectrometer at the stable isotope facility, SIRFER. The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of the use of nitrogen stable isotope patterns of macroinvertebrates and algae to observe potential anthropogenic impacts in streams that flow from a montane to urban ecosystem gradient. title is Macroinvertebrate and algae collection data. creator is Jackson, Simone. creator is Hall, Steven. creator is Zanden, Hannah Vander. creator is Bowling, David. creator is Baker, Michelle. creator is Ehleringer, James. author is Jackson, Simone. creator is Jackson, Simone. creator is Hall, Steven. creator is Zanden, Hannah Vander. creator is Bowling, David. creator is Baker, Michelle. creator is Ehleringer, James. subject is macroinvertebrates. subject is mayfly. subject is nitrogen. subject is algae. subject is isotope. subject is water quality. subject is carbon. availability is public. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Jackson, Simone.

 u'This example runs the \'landslide\' component of Landlab and is designed for undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning more about Landlab and landslide modeling.  Landlab is a Python-based landscape modeling environment and the landslide component is one of many components available for users to access and link together to build their own landscape model. For more information about Landlab, see http://landlab.github.io/#/.  Data needed for the example are spatial data on landscape characteristics for Thunder Creek watershed in North Cascade mountains of Washington.  They include soil, geology, vegetation, topography, and landform data that can be used for earth surface analyses such as landslides and hydrology.  Thus, the data can be used for more than this landslide example.  Elevation was acquired from STRM at 30 m grid scale;  the other datasets are matched to in scale and location.  Slope was derived from the elevation file and represents dimensionless "tan theta".  Specific contributing area represents the \'upstream\' area draining to each cell divided by the cell\'s width (so minimum value is 30 m).   Landform data was developed by Jon Riedel of National Park Service.  Landslides were extracted from these data as "mass wasting" events.  Land use and land cover (LULC) data were acquired from USGS National land Cover Data (NLCD) based on 2011 Landsat satellite data and grouped into eight general categories.  Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) provides the source of  lithology in its surface geology maps that displays rocks and deposits as geologic map units.  These were aggregated into eight classes based on similarities in origin and generally increasing strength by Dr. Riedel.  Cohesion represent root cohesion based on the LULC ; soils are assumed to be primarily cohesionless, lacking \u201ctrue cohesion\u201d because of their low clay content in this mountain terrain.   Soil depth comes from NRCS soil survey depth-to-restricted layer (weighted-average aggregation) within each soil map unit. Transmissivity was derived from the soil survey saturated hydraulic conductivity (depth averaged) multiplied by depth-to-restricted layer for each soil map unit. All soils within this watershed are sandy loam or loamy sand; therefore, soil surface texture was used as an indicator of internal angle of friction (phi).  A header file is also provided to understand the spatial details of the ASCII files and to facilitate capability with GIS.  Projection for raster mapping is NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_10N.\n\n[Modified in JupyterHub on 2016-10-04 23:07:36.160898]\nThis is a demo of the HydroShare Python Notebook Servertitle is Hello From JupyterHub. creator is Lilien, David. author is Lilien, David. creator is Lilien, David. subject is landslide. subject is Demo. subject is surface characteristic. subject is landscape characteristic. subject is Thunder Creek. subject is JupyterHub. availability is private. format is text/plain. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Lilien, David.

 u'Geohackweek is a 5-day workshop (November 14-18, 2016)  held at the University of Washington eScience Institute.  Participants came to the program with experience with Python programming and analysis of geospatial data (e.g. remote sensing analysis, vector mapping, environmental modeling, etc,) and learn more about open source technologies used to analyze geospatial datasets.  The Freshwaterhack includes a subset of the geohack projects that are related to hydrology, hydrologic modeling, and water resources in order to support open source tool development and data sharing and catalyze water research that can be translated to national and global scales.   The Freshwaterhack is facilitated by a collaborative network of Freshwater Science and Engineering coordinated by the Mountain to Sea Strategic Research Initiative, supported by UW College of Engineering, UW College of the Environment, and UW Tacoma. \r\n\r\nVisit the Github respoitory at https://github.com/geohackweek/geohackweek.github.io for more information. title is Freshwaterhack of UW Geohackweek. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. subject is geohack. subject is freshwater. organization is University of Washington. availability is public. coverage_type is box. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/8f74613935e84dcb9e4958229778f267/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/9700b80f5cfa42d4a52c9aaab81a4e11/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/3a3819de85e14fd2bb5ee9e05e616258/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/65893e1ed2dd4990b26db982d530fef6/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/dc67cb6ae7fb49bf9a0f5e73313df54a/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Arendt, Anthony. owner is Cristea, Nicoleta.

 u'A common challenge in interpreting and validating remote sensing data is in comparing these data to direct observations on the ground. Often remotely sensed data will cover large regions and have different temporal and spatial sampling frequency than point observations derived in the field. This kind of analysis requires geospatial tools to enable resampling, assessment of spatial statistics and extrapolation of point data to broader regions. The integration of satellite missions (GRACE) with hydrology models for determining drought indicators and water levels has been done in the United States (Houborg, et al., 2012; Zaitchick et al., 2008) using data assimilation from sophisticated observatory networks that are not available, for example, in sub-saharan Africa. However, there are studies that have analyzed operational, technical, institutional, financial, and environmental predictors of functionality for groundwater access (well) data collected from over 25,000 community-managed handpumps in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda (Foster, 2013). Lahren and Cook (2016) code and analyze the reasons for failure in 250,000 water points in 25 countries and found that 30% of boreholes are not functioning, either for "technical or mechanical\u201d reasons, or for "low quantity". According to the World Bank, water supply failure in Africa is estimated to \u201crepresent a lost investment in excess of $1.2 billion\u201d (Bonsor et. al. 2015). Women and girls continue to be the world\u2019s water collectors, spending a significant fraction of their time and energy on the task (Sorenson et al 2011, Graham et al 2016, Cook et al 2016). Can a planetary scale observational tool be used to understand groundwater access and vulnerability for domestic use in rural households? If so, we can further investigate and develop the GRACE for Girls project.\r\n\r\nResearch Questions\r\n\r\nHow much is hydrological scarcity contributing to handpump failure in Africa?\r\n\r\nIn areas where domestic water access is primarily through wells, are areas with non-functional wells because of low quantity observable with remote sensing data?\r\nWhat spatial statistics can be used to understand the reasons for well failure using geolocated water points and falling groundwater levels?\r\n\r\nSample data\r\n\r\nPoint data: The Water Point Data Exchange (WPDx) is a global platfrom for sharing water point data to understand water services with 240,000 + water points in the dataset with the quantity of data varying between government support for complete datasets (all 101,000 water points in Uganda) as well as data in other countries with known GRACE observable groundwater levels (India).\r\n\r\nThe WPDx data downloaded in February 2016, and coded for well failure due to water resources issues (Lahren and Cook (2016)), is provided on Hydroshare.

 u'Geospatial tools and visualization is needed to develop a data and model integration pipeline for assessing landslide hazards. \xa0This project is one component of multi-hazard (earthquake, flood, tsunami) assessment in watersheds spanning mountain peaks to coastal shores. \xa0A common challenge in interpreting and validating distributed models is in comparing these data to direct observations on the ground. Modeling data of landslides for regional planning intentionally cover large regions and many landslides, incorporating different temporal and spatial sampling frequency and stochastic processes than observations derived from landslide inventories developed in the field. This kind of analysis requires geospatial tools to enable visualization, assessment of spatial statistics and extrapolation of spatial data linked to hierarchical relationships, such as downstream hydrologic impacts. \xa0\r\nLandslide geohazards can be identified through numerous methods, which are generally grouped into quantitative (e.g., Hammond et al. 1992; Wu and Sidle 1995) and qualitative (e.g., Gupta and Joshi 1990; Carrara et al. 1991; Lee et al. 2007) approaches. Mechanistic process-based models based on limited equilibrium analysis can quantify the roles of topography, soils, vegetation, and hydrology (when coupled with a hydrologic model) in landsliding in quantitative forms (Montgomery and Dietrich 1994; Miller 1995; Pack et al. 1998). \xa0Processed-based models are good for predicting the initiation of landslides even where landslide inventories are lacking, but missed predictions likely stem from parameter uncertainty and unrepresented processes in model structure implicitly captured in qualitative approaches. A common qualitative approach develops landslide susceptibility based on experts rating multiple landscape attributes. \xa0These approaches provide general indices rather than quantified probabilities of relative landslide susceptibility applicable to the study location and cannot represent causal factors or triggering conditions that change in time (van Western et al. 2006). Both approaches rarely provide a probabilistic hazard in space and time, requisite for landslide risk assessments beneficial for planning and decision making (Smith 2013).\r\nThis project will start the groundwork to integrate numerical modeling developed by University of Washington \xa0with qualitative assessments of landslide susceptibility performed by Washington Department of Natural Resources. \r\n\r\ntitle is Freshwaterhack Project: Data integration for multi-hazard risk assessment. creator is Cakir, Recep. creator is Keck, Jeffrey. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Strauch, Ronda. creator is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. creator is Zou, Yuyang. creator is Nelson, Victoria. creator is Sai Siddhartha Nudurupati. author is Cakir, Recep. creator is Cakir, Recep. creator is Keck, Jeffrey. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Strauch, Ronda. creator is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. creator is Zou, Yuyang. creator is Nelson, Victoria. creator is Sai Siddhartha Nudurupati. subject is geohack. subject is landslide. organization is WA DNR - Geology Division. organization is WA DNR. organization is University of Washington. organization is University of Washington. organization is University of Washington. organization is WA DNR - Geology. organization is University of Washington - Seattle. availability is public. coverage_type is box. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/dbb68fd992cd413ebc677557e79116e1/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/f4c20d71b3ad4fecb0f17cf271010d18/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/a84a0b4bdb344f5d832adb1ebc4e927e/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/a771ba9bbae24ed8b4673c945fc321a3/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/d5d9bf20cfc1404c92c58e461a538c57/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/c1cc98ea070e4bbaae2900423a67d942/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/7bf798a123324d6eaca3f25084f1d5e1/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/ff258f9a13df4301a956ab4a7eb9df26/. relation is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/c18cef883695498c81acf9c4260d1e53/. resource_type is Collection Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Strauch, Ronda. owner is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. owner is Cakir, Recep. owner is Keck, Jeffrey.

The entry point will still be via iEMSS...assuming they are comfortable with that...and we want to pursue collaborative support from these groups:\r\n\r\n1) iEMSS as the principle supporter, home, entrypoint...etc.\r\n2) Hydroshare for community links and basic platform for hosting datasets, models, case descriptions, etc.\r\n3) USGS water group (Randy) - links perhaps and discussions on their website....we still need to discuss with Randy to be sure this is possible because it would be amazing! But we didn't get to discuss it explicitly before leaving for the airport.\r\n4) IAH - as an international group that frequently interacts with IWRM cases and could help us connect with more users/practitioners/etc.\r\n5) ...The Community or Collaborative Participation Conference and Association that Steven Gray is very involved in...I'll ask him via email and copy you and Sondoss.

 u'This dataset contains the results of water quality sampling efforts in the iUTAH GAMUT watersheds (Logan River, Red Butte Creek, and Provo River). There were two separate sampling and analysis efforts: \r\n1. A "synoptic" effort that involved sample collection every month at a number of sites in  2013-2014. For this effort, samples were analyzed for total phosphorus and total nitrogen, total coliform, E.coli, and water isotopes. \r\n2. A "biweekly" effort that involved sample collection every two weeks and a smaller number of sites (mostly at GAMUT aquatic stations) in 2014-2016. For this effort, samples were analyzed for species of nitrogen and phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon,  suspended and volatile solids, total coliform and E.coli, chlorophyll-a, and fluorescence indices. \r\n\r\nIn all cases, grab samples were collected from the thalweg of the channel. For the biweekly effort, samples were filtered for analyses of dissolved species, and filters were retained for TSS and VSS analysis. Nutrient, organic matter, and chlorophyll-a analyses were performed at the Aquatic Biogeochemistry Laboratory at Utah State University. Isotope analyses were performed at the Stable Isotope Ratio Facility for Environmental Research at the University of Utah. Bacterial analyses were performed either at the Aanderud Laboratory at Brigham Young University or by technicians in the field. Detailed collection and analyses methods are described in the files.\r\n\r\nThe current Excel files are organized with worksheets corresponding to People and Organizations, Dataset Citation, Methods, Variables, Sites, Specimens, Processing Levels, Units, and Analysis_Results. The Specimens sheet includes detailed metadata on the collection of the specimens, including the date and time.

 u'Irrigation of lawns and gardens in Cedar City, Utah is accomplished in two fundamentally different manners. In older neighborhoods, water is diverted from a natural stream (Coal Creek) into a series of canals and ditches for residential flood irrigation, compared to newer neighborhoods, which use sprinklers or similar devices from well water. The overall objective of this project is to better understand the chemical and biological changes that occur in irrigation and runoff waters in Cedar City. We are addressing the following hypotheses. 1) Changes will be observed in water chemistry as surface water moves from Coal Creek through Cedar City. 2) Irrigation strategies influence water chemistry during periods of high precipitation. 3) Microbial community changes will be associated with differences in water chemistry. Water chemistry data including dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, alkalinity, dissolved organic matter and nitrate/nitrite were collected weekly at eight sites during May to October in 2014 and 2015, and during high precipitation events.  Water chemistry changes were observed with  a reduction in alkalinity levels among all sites. No significant differences in water chemistry were observed as water moved from the diversion site through Cedar City with the exception of the final southern site (S3), The Lake on the Hill, having significantly (p<0.05) lower TDS and Salinity, and a Higher DO and pH than all other sites in both the northern and southern drainages. There was a significant difference between temperature and DO levels measured in the southern and northern irrigation ditches with a significantly  (p<0.05) higher temperature and lower DO in the southern irrigation ditches. During high precipitation periods, nitrate was detected in newer neighborhoods. Dissolved oxygen and pH were at higher levels, while salinity and conductivity were lower in a reservoir site relative to irrigation canals. No significant differences were observed between older and newer neighborhoods. However differences were found between the upstream diversion site and the water collected in Cedar City, with lower DO, TDS, Alkalinities and Salinities in Cedar City irrigation ditches. No differences were observed in bacterial communities for any of the sampled sites.title is Cedar City Coal Creek Irrigation Data. creator is Govedich, Fred. creator is Bain, Bonnie. creator is Spruell, Paul. author is Govedich, Fred. creator is Govedich, Fred. creator is Bain, Bonnie. creator is Spruell, Paul. subject is Coal Creek. subject is water chemistry. subject is Utah. subject is Cedar City. subject is iUTAH. subject is irrigation water. organization is Southern Utah University, Dixie State University. organization is Eastern Washington University. availability is private. coverage_type is box. coverage_type is period. format is image/jpeg. format is text/csv. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Govedich, Fred. owner is Iutah Data manager.

 u'This resource provides a table of root cohesion values (kPa) to use when reclassifying land use/land cover (LULC) rasters to cohesion rasters.  LULC can be acquired from USGS National Land Cover Data (NLCD) based on 2011 Landsat satellite data (USGS 2014b; Jin 2013) and should be grouped into eight generalized categories: water, wetland, snow/ice, barren, herbaceous, shrub/scrub, forest, and developed.  The root cohesion rasters can then be used in landslide modeling as parameters needed to create triangle distributions. The distributions  will be right skewed, which is typically found in field data (Hammond et al. 1992).  Spatially distributed values for root cohesion based on LULC were determined from Schmidt et al. (2001) and other literature, except for barren and developed classifications that were assumed to have few roots and thus, small root cohesion. title is Root Cohesion Table. creator is Strauch, Ronda. creator is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. author is Strauch, Ronda. creator is Strauch, Ronda. creator is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. subject is cohesion. subject is landslide. subject is land use. subject is land cover. organization is University of Washington. organization is University of Washington. availability is public. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Strauch, Ronda.

 u'There is an important gap in flood modeling: flood models do not sufficiently resolve sediment dynamics in river networks and related consequences for channel conveyance.   Especially in tectonically active regions, changes in channel capacity due to geomorphic processes may sometimes be as or more important than the frequency of high discharge events in determining flood risks.  \r\n\r\nAlex Bryk et al. at UC Berkeley have been using Earth Engine to study geomorphology.

 u"This is a tutorial that will walk you through the steps to import a DEM into Landlab and create a raster model grid. \r\n\r\nNote: To use this tutorial, you should have Landlab (version 1.0) installed on your computer. To install Landlab, please follow the instructions @ https://landlab.github.io/#/#install\r\n\r\nThe starting point is to obtain a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in ESRI's Ascii Grid format, or convert it to this format. The format consists of a 6-line header followed by elevation values. Here we'll work with a small example DEM file 'west_bijou_gully.asc' (attached in this resource). The header for this file is as follows:\r\nncols        43\r\nnrows        89\r\nxllcorner    559705.000000000000\r\nyllcorner    4380220.000000000000\r\ncellsize     3\r\nNODATA_value 0\r\nHere, our objective is to translate the contents of this file into a Landlab RasterModelGrid.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial also illustrates setting boundary conditions on DEMs and using the halo option for reading in DEMs without nodata values around the edges.\r\nFor this we will use the resource 'synthetic_landsacpe.asc'.\r\n\r\nCiting Landlab:\r\nTucker, G.E., Gasparini, N.M., Istanbulluoglu, E., Hobley, D.E.J., Nudurupati, S.S., Adams, J.M., and Hutton, E.

 u'This example runs the \'landslide\' component of Landlab and is designed for undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning more about Landlab and landslide modeling.  Landlab is a Python-based landscape modeling environment and the landslide component is one of many components available for users to access and link together to build their own landscape model. For more information about Landlab, see http://landlab.github.io/#/.  Data needed for the example are spatial data on landscape characteristics for Thunder Creek watershed in North Cascade mountains of Washington.  They include soil, geology, vegetation, topography, and landform data that can be used for earth surface analyses such as landslides and hydrology.  Thus, the data can be used for more than this landslide example.  Elevation was acquired from STRM at 30 m grid scale;  the other datasets are matched to in scale and location.  Slope was derived from the elevation file and represents dimensionless "tan theta".  Specific contributing area represents the \'upstream\' area draining to each cell divided by the cell\'s width (so minimum value is 30 m).   Landform data was developed by Jon Riedel of National Park Service.  Landslides were extracted from these data as "mass wasting" events.  Land use and land cover (LULC) data were acquired from USGS National land Cover Data (NLCD) based on 2011 Landsat satellite data and grouped into eight general categories.  Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) provides the source of  lithology in its surface geology maps that displays rocks and deposits as geologic map units.  These were aggregated into eight classes based on similarities in origin and generally increasing strength by Dr. Riedel.  Cohesion represent root cohesion based on the LULC ; soils are assumed to be primarily cohesionless, lacking \u201ctrue cohesion\u201d because of their low clay content in this mountain terrain.   Soil depth comes from NRCS soil survey depth-to-restricted layer (weighted-average aggregation) within each soil map unit. Transmissivity was derived from the soil survey saturated hydraulic conductivity (depth averaged) multiplied by depth-to-restricted layer for each soil map unit. All soils within this watershed are sandy loam or loamy sand; therefore, soil surface texture was used as an indicator of internal angle of friction (phi).  A header file is also provided to understand the spatial details of the ASCII files and to facilitate capability with GIS.  Projection for raster mapping is NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_10N.\n\n[Modified in JupyterHub on 2016-11-16 21:39:32.105699]\nThis is a demo of the HydroShare Python Notebook Servertitle is Hello From JupyterHub. creator is Porter, Matthew. author is Porter, Matthew. creator is Porter, Matthew. subject is surface characteristic. subject is landslide. subject is JupyterHub. subject is landscape characteristic. subject is Thunder Creek. subject is Demo. availability is private. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. format is text/plain. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Porter, Matthew.

 u'ANUGA is a hydrodynamic modelling tool that allows users to model realistic flow problems in complex 2D geometries. Examples include dam breaks or the effects of natural hazards such as riverine flooding, storm surges and tsunami. The user must specify a study area represented by a mesh of triangular cells, the topography and bathymetry, frictional resistance, initial values for water level (called stage within ANUGA), boundary conditions and forces such as rainfall, stream flows, windstress or pressure gradients if applicable.\nANUGA tracks the evolution of water depth and horizontal momentum within each cell over time by solving the shallow water wave governing equation using a finite-volume method.\nANUGA also incorporates a mesh generator that allows the user to set up the geometry of the problem interactively as well as tools for interpolation and surface fitting, and a number of auxiliary tools for visualising and interrogating the model output.\nMost ANUGA components are written in the object-oriented programming language Python and most users will interact with ANUGA by writing small Python scripts based on the ANUGA library functions. Computationally intensive components are written for efficiency in C routines working directly with Python numpy structures.title is Anuga. creator is Shmo, Joe. author is Shmo, Joe. creator is Shmo, Joe. subject is continental,. availability is private. coverage_type is period. format is image/png. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is https://sourceforge.net/projects/anuga/. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Sadler, Jeff.

 u'This project describes a case study of continuous rainfall-runoff modeling in part of Red Butte Creek watershed, Salt Lake City, Utah using ArcGIS and the Hydrologic Engineering Center \u2013 Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) version 4.1 to estimate runoff in the red butte creek. ArcGIS tools are used to process a DEM to delineate watershed, stream network, and extract other watershed parameter and characteristic that could be used as input for many hydrological models. In this study, a continuous soil moisture accounting (SMA) and temperature index (Degree-day) snowmelt methods were used to simulate the long-term relationship between rainfall, interception, surface storage, infiltration, snowmelt, runoff, ground water percolation and evapotranspiration. Simple canopy, simple surface, Muskingum, Clark Unit hydrograph, recession, and Priestley Taylor were used for canopy, surface, routing, transform, base flow, and evapotranspiration methods respectively. The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance and potentiality of the HMS with the SMA and temperature index algorithms on a small part of red butte creek. The SMA and temperature index algorithms in HEC-HMS was calibrated using 1-year streamflow data from Feb 2014 to Feb 2015. Sensitivity analysis of model parameters has been conducted. ATI-Melt rate function and maximum infiltration rate were found to be most sensitive parameters within snowmelt and SMA methods for this watershed, respectively. Statistical evaluation was conducted to determine the performance of the HEC-HMS model and found to be Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency EFC = 0.796. Overall, the temperature index and SMA procedure in the HEC-HMS conceptual model performed satisfactorily and can be used for long-term runoff modeling in the red butte creek.title is Continuous Rainfall-Runoff Modeling. creator is Limbu, Sal. author is Limbu, Sal. creator is Limbu, Sal. subject is GISWR2016. availability is public. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Limbu, Sal.

 u'.  For this study, a geo-referenced, HEC-RAS hydraulic model was developed and utilized to simulate dam failure scenarios under normal and extreme hydrologic loading conditions, for Longview Dam, Missouri, to aid in consequence estimation.  \r\n\r\nLongview Dam is located on the Little Blue River (River Mile 42.9) in Jackson County, in the northwestern portion of Missouri.  The drainage area is approximately 50.3 square miles.  The travel time for water downstream of Longview Lake is 13 hours to the Lake City gage, and 21 hours to the Missouri River.\r\n  \r\nThe project operates for Flood Control, Water Quality, Recreation, and Fish and Wildlife Conservation.  Longview Dam is 1,900 feet long, 110 feet high, and is constructed of rolled earthfill.  The lake began the filling process on 1 September, 1985, and the multi-purpose pool level was reached in September of 1986.\r\n\r\nLongview Lake has a multipurpose area of 927 acres, and the flood control pool area is 1,965 acres.

 u'The general approach to dam failure modeling for risk assessment requires use of HEC-GeoRAS and HEC-RAS for development and analysis of geo-referenced, unsteady hydraulic models.  The tie to geographic information systems allows for efficient model development and utilization of results for estimation of consequences.  General methodology for development and simulation of the dam failure hydraulic model was taken from the MMC Standard Operating Procedure presentation called \u201c3.1.3 - Using HEC-RAS to Perform a Dam Break.\u201d\r\n\r\nInput data for the dam failure model was developed within the GIS environment using HEC-GeoRAS.  A stream network and cross section layout was developed using aerial photography and a digital terrain model as a guide.  Cross sections were placed to show changes in channel geometry.  Storage in backwater reaches was incorporated by either extending the main channel cross sections into the backwater reach or by adding a storage area in the model.  Bank lines and flow path lines were digitized based on preliminary floodplain runs.  Additional geometric features (e.g. ineffective flow areas) were input as necessary.  The pool volume upstream of the dam, as well as the elevation-discharge rating table for the gate/outlet structure, was taken from the water control manual.  An inline weir was used to represent the Longview Dam structure.  \r\n\r\nPrevious hydraulic models for the Little Blue River were not provided by the Kansas City District (NWK).  However, a large portion of the Missouri River was taken from an existing model for the Upper Mississippi / Missouri River Flow Frequency Study.  In order to merge the two river systems in a hydraulic model, cross sections for the Missouri River were re-cut in ArcGIS, so that there would be no overlap between the Missouri and Little Blue Rivers.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri River Levee was actually the point in the model at which the two rivers were divided.  The levee was modeled as a lateral weir structure, so that if high flood flows overtopped the levee, they would flow directly into the Missouri River, instead of continuing downstream on the Little Blue River.\r\ntitle is Longview Lake Hydraulic Model (HEC-RAS). creator is Sheeley, Jason. author is Sheeley, Jason. creator is Sheeley, Jason. subject is MO82202. subject is Dam Breach Model. subject is HEC-RAS. subject is Longview Lake. subject is USACE. organization is US Army Corps of Engineers. availability is private. format is application/b01. format is application/b02. format is application/b03. format is application/b04. format is application/b05. format is application/b06. format is application/b07. format is application/b08. format is application/b09. format is application/b10. format is application/bco01. format is application/bco02. format is application/c01. format is application/c02. format is application/dsc. format is application/dss. format is application/g01. format is application/g02. format is application/O01. format is application/O02. format is application/O03. format is application/O04. format is application/O05. format is application/O06. format is application/O07. format is application/O08. format is application/O09. format is application/O10. format is application/p01. format is application/blf. format is text/plain. format is application/002. format is application/p02. format is application/p03. format is application/p04. format is application/p05. format is application/p06. format is application/p07. format is application/p08. format is application/p09. format is application/p10. format is application/prj. format is application/r01. format is application/r02. format is application/r03. format is application/r04. format is application/r05. format is application/r06. format is application/r07. format is application/r08. format is application/r09. format is application/r10. format is application/u01. format is application/u02. format is application/u03. format is application/u04. format is application/u05. format is application/x01. format is application/x02. format is application/rasmap. format is application/bco07. format is application/bco05. format is application/bco06. format is application/bco08. format is application/bco04. format is application/bco09. format is application/bco10. format is application/bco03. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Instance Resource. owner is Sheeley, Jason.

 u'In hydrology, water data and specifically streamflow, has been an interesting issue, and historical observations of streamflow are collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Additionally, several hydrologic models are used to produce forecasts of streamflow conditions in the future. Among efforts to forecast streamflow, the most recent endeavors to predict streamflow have led to the development, launch, and unveiling of America\u2019s first National Water Model (NWM) on August 16, 2016. This model forecasts more precise, detailed, frequent, and expanded water information that can be utilized by various communities to improve water-related decisions. However, researchers who aim to use NWM forecast data may face some problems due to the retrieval, management, and analysis of these data. To cope with these challenges, a retrieval code (NWM_USGS_retrieval) that facilitates and automates the process of querying and retrieving data was generated in this project using the Python scripting language and demonstrated in a Jupyter IPython Notebook.title is NWM_USGS_retrieval. creator is Garousi-nejad, Irene. author is Garousi-nejad, Irene. creator is Garousi-nejad, Irene. subject is JupyterHub. subject is NWM. subject is USGS. subject is Streamflow. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. format is application/ipynb. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Garousi-nejad, Irene.

 u'How do you share and publish hydrologic data and models for a large collaborative project? HydroShare is a new, web-based system for sharing hydrologic data and models with specific functionality aimed at making collaboration easier. HydroShare has been developed with U.S. National Science Foundation support under the auspices of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) to support the collaboration and community cyberinfrastructure needs of the hydrology research community. Within HydroShare, we have developed new functionality for creating datasets, describing them with metadata, and sharing them with collaborators. We cast hydrologic datasets and models as \u201csocial objects\u201d that can be shared, collaborated around, annotated, published and discovered. In addition to data and model sharing, HydroShare supports web application programs (apps) that can act on data stored in HydroShare, just as software programs on your PC act on your data locally. This can free you from some of the limitations of local computing capacity and challenges in installing and maintaining software on your own PC. HydroShare\u2019s web-based cyberinfrastructure can take work off your desk or laptop computer and onto infrastructure or "cloud" based data and processing servers. This presentation will describe HydroShare\u2019s collaboration functionality that enables both public and private sharing with individual users and collaborative user groups, and makes it easier for collaborators to iterate on shared datasets and models, creating multiple versions along the way, and publishing them with a permanent landing page, metadata description, and citable Digital Object Identifier (DOI) when the work is complete. This presentation will also describe the web app architecture that supports interoperability with third party servers functioning as application engines for analysis and processing of big hydrologic datasets. While developed to support the cyberinfrastructure needs of the hydrology community, the informatics infrastructure for programmatic interoperability of web resources has a generality beyond the solution of hydrology problems that will be discussed.\r\n\r\nPresentation IN33C-03: at AGU Fall Meeting December 14, 2016title is Data and Models as Social Objects in the HydroShare System for Collaboration in the Hydrology Community and Beyond. creator is Tarboton, David. creator is Idaszak, Ray. creator is Horsburgh, Jeffery S.. creator is Ames, Dan. creator is Goodall, Jon. creator is Band, Lawrence. creator is Venkatesh Merwade. creator is Couch, Alva. creator is Hooper, Richard. creator is Maidment, David. creator is Dash, Pabitra. creator is Stealey, Michael J.. creator is Yi, Hong. creator is Gan, Tian. creator is Castronova, Anthony Michael. creator is Miles, Brian. creator is Li, Zhiyu. creator is Morsy, Mohamed. creator is Crawley, Shawn. creator is Ramirez, Mauriel. creator is Sadler, Jeff. creator is Xue, Zhaokun. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. author is Tarboton, David. creator is Tarboton, David. creator is Idaszak, Ray. creator is Horsburgh, Jeffery S.. creator is Ames, Dan. creator is Goodall, Jon. creator is Band, Lawrence. creator is Venkatesh Merwade. creator is Couch, Alva. creator is Hooper, Richard. creator is Maidment, David. creator is Dash, Pabitra. creator is Stealey, Michael J.. creator is Yi, Hong. creator is Gan, Tian. creator is Castronova, Anthony Michael. creator is Miles, Brian. creator is Li, Zhiyu. creator is Morsy, Mohamed. creator is Crawley, Shawn. creator is Ramirez, Mauriel. creator is Sadler, Jeff. creator is Xue, Zhaokun. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. subject is AGU2016. subject is HydroShare. subject is Presentation. organization is Utah State University. organization is RENCI, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. organization is Utah State University. organization is Brigham Young University. organization is Univeristy of Virginia. organization is UNC Chapel Hill. organization is Purdue University. organization is CUAHSI. organization is USU. organization is RENCI. organization is RENCI at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. organization is Utah State University. organization is BYU. organization is University of Virginia. organization is Brigham Young University. organization is Utah State University. organization is University of Washington. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Tarboton, David.

 u'ANUGA is a hydrodynamic modelling tool that allows users to model realistic flow problems in complex 2D geometries. Examples include dam breaks or the effects of natural hazards such as riverine flooding, storm surges and tsunami. The user must specify a study area represented by a mesh of triangular cells, the topography and bathymetry, frictional resistance, initial values for water level (called stage within ANUGA), boundary conditions and forces such as rainfall, stream flows, windstress or pressure gradients if applicable.\nANUGA tracks the evolution of water depth and horizontal momentum within each cell over time by solving the shallow water wave governing equation using a finite-volume method.\nANUGA also incorporates a mesh generator that allows the user to set up the geometry of the problem interactively as well as tools for interpolation and surface fitting, and a number of auxiliary tools for visualising and interrogating the model output.\nMost ANUGA components are written in the object-oriented programming language Python and most users will interact with ANUGA by writing small Python scripts based on the ANUGA library functions.

 u'The Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) distributed hydrological model is a hybrid modeling strategy that was recently developed by the University of Oklahoma (http://hydro.ou.edu) and NASA SERVIR Project Team. CREST simulates the spatiotemporal variation of water and energy fluxes and storages on a regular grid with the grid cell resolution being user-defined, thereby enabling global- and regional-scale applications. The scalability of CREST simulations is accomplished through sub-grid scale representation of soil moisture storage capacity (using a variable infiltration curve) and runoff generation processes (using linear reservoirs).  The CREST model was initially developed to provide online global flood predictions with relatively coarse resolution, but it is also applicable at small scales, such as single basins. This README file and the accompanying code concentrates on and tests the model at the small scale. The CREST Model can be forced by gridded potential evapotranspiration and precipitation datasets such as, satellite-based precipitation estimates, gridded rain gauge observations, remote sensing platforms such as weather radar, and quantitative precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction models.  The representation of the primary water fluxes such as infiltration and routing are closely related to the spatially variable land surface characteristics (i.e., vegetation, soil type, and topography).  The runoff generation component and routing scheme are coupled, thus providing realistic interactions between atmospheric, land surface, and subsurface water.title is CREST. creator is Wang, Jiahu. author is Wang, Jiahu. creator is Wang, Jiahu. subject is continental,. organization is Center for Natural Hazard and Disaster Study, National Weather Center. availability is public. format is application/x-msdos-program. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Morgan, Edward. owner is Sadler, Jeff. extra is Input Parameters: DEM\nPrecipitation\nPotential Evapotranspiration. extra is Output Parameters: CREST outputs consist of several variables, including:\nstorage depths of the vegetation canopy,\nthe three soil layers, and two linear reservoirs,\nrelative change of the six reservoir levels representing actual evapotranspiration from the canopy and soil layers,\noverland and interflow excess rain,\noverland and interflow runoff..

 u'DR3M is a watershed model for routing storm runoff through a Branched system of pipes and (or) natural channels using rainfall as input. DR3M provides detailed simulation of storm-runoff periods selected by the user. There is daily soil-moisture accounting between storms. A drainage basin is represented as a set of overland-flow, channel, and reservoir segments, which jointly describe the drainage features of the basin. This model is usually used to simulate small urban basins. Interflow and base flow are not simulated. Snow accumulation and snowmelt are not simulated.\r\n\r\nInput Parameters:\r\naily precipitation, daily evapotranspiration, and short-interval precipitation are required. Short-interval discharge is required for the optimization option and to calibrate the model. These time series are read from a WDM file. Roughness and hydraulics parameters and sub-catchment areas are required to define the basin. Six parameters are required to calculate infiltration and soil-moisture accounting. Up to three rainfall stations may be used. Two soil types may be defined. A total of 99 flow planes, channels, pipes, reservoirs, and junctions may be used to define the basin.\r\n\r\nOutput Parameters:\r\nThe computed outflow from any flow plane, pipe, or channel segment for each storm period may be written to the output file or to the WDM file. A summary of the measured and simulated rainfall, runoff, and peak flows is written to the output file. A flat file containing the storm rainfall, measured flow (if available), and simulated flow at user selected sites can be generated. A flat file for each storm containing the total rainfall, the measured peak flow (if available), and the simulated peak flow for user-selected sites can be generated.\r\n\r\nProcess:\r\nThe rainfall-excess components include soil-moisture accounting, pervious-area rainfall excess, impervious-area rainfall excess, and parameter optimization. The Green-Ampt equation is used in the calculations of infiltration and pervious area rainfall excess. A Rosenbrock optimization procedure may be used to aid in calibrating several of the infiltration and soil-moisture accounting parameters. Kinematic wave theory is used for both overland-flow and channel routing. There are three solution techniques available: method of characteristics, implicit finite difference method, and explicit finite difference method. Two soil types may be defined. Overland flow may be defined as turbulent or laminar. Detention reservoirs may be simulated as linear storage or using a modified-Puls method. Channel segments may be defined as gutter, pipe, triangular cross section, or by explicitly specifying the kinematic channel parameters alpha and m.\r\ntitle is DR3M. author is none. subject is basins,. organization is US Geological Survey. availability is public. format is text/plain. format is application/x-tar. format is application/x-msdos-program. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Morgan, Edward. owner is Sadler, Jeff.

 u"GEOtop accommodates very complex topography and, besides the water balance integrates all the terms in the surface energy balance equation. For saturated and unsaturated subsurface flow, it uses the 3D Richards\u2019 equation. An accurate treatment of radiation inputs is implemented in order to be able to return surface temperature.\nThe model GEOtop simulates the complete hydrological balance in a continuous way, during a whole year, inside a basin and combines the main features of the modern land surfaces models with the distributed rainfall-runoff models.\nThe new 0.875 version of GEOtop introduces the snow accumulation and melt module and describes sub-surface flows in an unsaturated media more accurately. With respect to the version 0.750 the updates are fundamental: the codex is completely eviewed, the energy and mass parametrizations are rewritten, the input/output file set is redifined.\nGEOtop makes it possible to know the outgoing discharge at the basin's closing section, to estimate the local values at the ground of humidity, of soil temperature, of sensible and latent heat fluxes, of heat flux in the soil and of net radiation, together with other hydrometeorlogical distributed variables. Furthermore it describes the distributed snow water equivalent and surface snow temperature.\nGEOtop is a model based on the use of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). It makes also use of meteorological measurements obtained thought traditional instruments on the ground. Yet, it can also assimilate distributed data like those coming from radar measurements, from satellite terrain sensing or from micrometeorological models.title is GEOtop. creator is Rigon, Riccardo. creator is Endrizzi, Stefano. creator is Dall'Amico, Matteo. author is Rigon, Riccardo. creator is Rigon, Riccardo. creator is Endrizzi, Stefano. creator is Dall'Amico, Matteo. subject is basins,. organization is University of Trento. availability is public. format is text/plain. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Morgan, Edward. owner is Sadler, Jeff.

 u'MODFLOW is a three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water model that was first published in 1984. It has a modular structure that allows it to be easily modified to adapt the code for a particular application.  Many new capabilities have been added to the original model.  OFR 00-92 (complete reference below) documents a general update to MODFLOW, which is called MODFLOW-2000 in order to distinguish it from earlier versions.\nMODFLOW-2000 simulates steady and nonsteady flow in an irregularly shaped flow system in which aquifer layers can be confined, unconfined, or a combination of confined and unconfined. Flow from external stresses, such as flow to wells, areal recharge, evapotranspiration, flow to drains, and flow through river beds, can be simulated. Hydraulic conductivities or transmissivities for any layer may differ spatially and be anisotropic (restricted to having the principal directions aligned with the grid axes), and the storage coefficient may be heterogeneous. Specified head and specified flux boundaries can be simulated as can a head dependent flux across the model\'s outer boundary that allows water to be supplied to a boundary block in the modeled area at a rate proportional to the current head difference between a "source" of water outside the modeled area and the boundary block.  MODFLOW is currently the most used numerical model in the U.S. Geological Survey for ground-water flow problems.\nIn addition to simulating ground-water flow, the scope of MODFLOW-2000 has been expanded to incorporate related capabilities such as solute transport and parameter estimation.title is MODFLOW-2000. creator is Barlow, Paul. creator is Harbaugh, Arlen. creator is Banta, Edward. creator is Hill, Mary. creator is Winston, Richard. author is Barlow, Paul. creator is Barlow, Paul. creator is Harbaugh, Arlen. creator is Banta, Edward. creator is Hill, Mary. creator is Winston, Richard. subject is basins,. organization is U.S. Geological Survey. organization is U.S. Geological Survey. organization is U.S. Geological Survey. organization is U.S. Geological Survey. organization is U.S. Geological Survey. availability is public. format is application/x-msdos-program. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Morgan, Edward. owner is Sadler, Jeff.

 u"TopoFlow is a powerful, spatially-distributed hydrologic model with a user-friendly point-and-click interface. Its main purpose is to model many different physical processes in a watershed with the goal of accurately predicting how various hydrologic variables will evolve in time in response to climatic forcings.\r\nModeled processes include:\r\nChannelized flow (kinematic, diffusive or dynamic wave, all 1D and D8-based)\r\nOverland flow\r\nSnowmelt (degree-day or energy balance)\r\nIcemelt (from valley glaciers using GC2D)\r\nMeteorology (including precipitation, air temperature, shortwave and longwave radiation, etc.)\r\nEvaporation (Priestley-Taylor or energy balance)\r\nInfiltration (Green-Ampt, Smith-Parlange or Richards' 1D, multi-layer), *Shallow subsurface flow (Darcy, up to 6 layers)\r\nFlow diversions (sinks, sources or canals)\r\n\r\nEach process can have its own timestep. Typical timesteps are:\r\nChannel flow (seconds)\r\nInfiltration (seconds to minutes)\r\nSnowmelt (hours to days)\r\nSubsurface flow (hours to days), etc.\r\nModel can be run for a full year or longer, if necessary.\r\n\r\nOverland flow is currently modeled in a nonstandard way. Diffusive wave and dynamic wave routing routines need more testing. The linkage between the unsaturated zone (infiltration component) and saturated zone (subsurface flow component and water table) is not robust.\r\n\r\nAvailable test datat sets:\r\nTreynor watershed, in the Nishnabotna River basin, Iowa, USA.

 u"Landlab is a Python software package for creating, assembling, and/or running 2D numerical models. Landlab was created to facilitate modeling in earth-surface dynamics, but it is general enough to support a wide range of applications. Landlab provides three different capabilities:\r\n(1) A DEVELOPER'S TOOLKIT for efficiently building 2D models from scratch. The toolkit includes a powerful GRIDDING ENGINE for creating, managing, and iterative updating data on 2D structured or unstructured grids. The toolkit also includes helpful utilities to handle model input and output.\r\n\r\n(2) A set of pre-built COMPONENTS, each of which models a particular process. Components can be combined together to create coupled models.\r\n\r\n(3) A library of pre-built MODELS that have been created by combining components together.\r\n\r\nTo learn more, please visit http://landlab.github.io\r\n\r\nInput Parameters: \r\nBecause this is a toolkit for model building, there are no set input parameters. Rather, developers use the code to create their own models, with their own unique inputs.\r\nThe ModelParameterDictionary tool provides formatted ASCII input for model parameters. The I/O component also handles input of digital elevation models (DEMs) in standard ArcInfo ASCII format.\r\n\r\nOutput Parameters: \r\nGridding component provides ASCII and/or netCDF output of grid geometry.\r\ntitle is Landlab. creator is Tucker, Greg. creator is Gasparini, Nicole. creator is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. creator is Hutton, Eric. author is Tucker, Greg. creator is Tucker, Greg. creator is Gasparini, Nicole. creator is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. creator is Hutton, Eric. subject is Python. subject is 2D. organization is University of Colorado. organization is Tulane University. organization is University of Washington. organization is University of Colorado. availability is public. format is application/zip. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Morgan, Edward. owner is Sadler, Jeff.

 u'The purpose of this study is to evaluate the downstream impacts of potential dam failure scenarios for Hords Creek Dam. HEC-RAS was used to route flood hydrographs to simulate Hords Creek Dam failure scenarios. The dam failure analyses were simulated under five hydrologic loading conditions. Two dam breaches analyzed with static water surface elevations at normal low (90 percent exceedance duration pool) and normal high (10 percent exceedance duration pool) loading conditions. Three dam breaches were analyzed with unsteady inflows to represent a security scenario pool (1 percent exceedance duration pool), top of active storage pool, and maximum high pool. The 10 percent exceedance duration pool failure represents a worst case \u201csunny day\u201d situation. Maximum high failure represents a worst case dam failure scenario.title is Hords Creek. creator is Christopher, Adrian. creator is Sheeley, Jason. author is Christopher, Adrian. creator is Christopher, Adrian. creator is Sheeley, Jason. subject is Hords Creek. subject is TX00006. subject is SWF. organization is USACE. organization is US Army Corps of Engineers. availability is private. coverage_type is period. coverage_type is box. format is application/dss. format is text/plain. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Instance Resource. owner is Christopher, Adrian. owner is Crosby, Wesley. extra is Model Review: Extend cross sections..

 u'Snow persistence (SP) or the snow cover index (SCI), is the fraction of time that snow is present on the ground for a defined period. No data index (NDI) is the fraction of time that there is no data, cloud, or sensor saturation for the same period. SP and NDI were calculated on a pixel by pixel basis using MODIS/Terra Snow Cover 8-Day L3 Global 500m Grid, Collection 5 obtained from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). We computed the 1 January \u2013 3 July SP for each year as the fraction of 8-day MODIS images with snow present. The selected period brackets the temporal extent of peak snow accumulation to complete snow ablation in most parts of the western United States. Spatial coverage is for MODIS tiles h08v04, h08v05, h09v04, h09v05, and h10v04. The 3 July date is used because the 8-day MODIS image does not fall on the first of the month in this case.

(2016), Storm-triggered landslides in the Peruvian Andes and implications for topography, carbon cycles, and biodiversity, Earth Surface Dynamics, 4, 47-70, doi: 10.5194/esurf-4-47-2016.\r\n\r\nLandslides within the Kos\xf1ipata Valley in Peru were manually mapped over a 25-year period from 1988 to 2012 using Landsat 5 (Landsat Thematic Mapper) and Landsat 7 (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) satellite images. The landslide inventory was produced by manually mapping landslide scars and their deposits in ArcGIS and by verifying via ground truthing of scars in the field. Mapping involved visually comparing images from one year to the next, specifically evaluating contrasting colour changes that suggest a landslide had occurred. The landslide areas visible via spectral contrast in the Landsat images include regions of failure, run-out areas, and deposits. Pan-sharpened high-resolution Quickbird and Worldview images were used to define the landslide boundaries.\r\n\r\nTopographic shadow produced by hillslopes covered a minimum of 21% of the study area (35 km2 out of 185 km2), predominantly on southwest-facing slopes was consistently present between images. Landslides that fell within these shadow areas were not visible. Any landslides that were partially mapped underneath the Landsat topographic shadow were removed (see Figure 2a in Clark et al. 2016).\r\n\r\nThis product was created by Kathryn Clark (kathryn.clark23@gmail.com).  \r\n\r\nOther spatial datasets from Clark et al.

The Kos\xf1ipata River at the San Pedro gauging station drains an area of 164.4 km2. Field measurements consisted of river height, flow velocity, and cross-sectional area, which together allowed us to estimate discharge and runoff over the study period. River stage height was measured from January 2010 to February 2011 using a river logger (GlobalWater WL16 Data Logger, range 0\u20139 m), recording river level every 15 min. The instantaneous discharge associated with each height measurement was calculated based on calibrated stage\u2013discharge relationships. The Kos\xf1ipata River discharge at San Pedro was measured through a complete water year,  with a 31-day gap partly in July and August (during low flow) that was covered by three manual measurements and the gap was filled using linear interpolation.\r\n\r\nSheet 2: Weekly to monthly discharge measurements at the Wayqecha gauging station (2250 m.a.s.l), along the Kos\xf1ipata River, in the Andes of Peru. The Wayqecha sub-catchment a nested catchment upstream of the San Pedro gauging station. It  encompasses the headwaters of the Kos\xf1ipata River, draining an area of 48.5 km2 (See the supplementary information in Clark et al. 2014).

 u"Links to the repository (https://github.com/dzeke/Blended-Near-Optimal-Tools) that stores the Matlab 2013a source code and (1) Documentation for blended near-optimal tools that (2) generate alternatives, (3) visualize alternatives, and allow a user to interactively explore the near-optimal region from which alternatives are generated. Also contains the data and model files for a (4) linear programming example application to manage water quality for Echo Reservoir, Utah, (5) mixed-integer programming example application to manage water supply and demands in Amman, Jordan, and (6) multi-objective linear programming reservoir operations problem.\r\n\r\nNear-optimal alternatives perform within a (near-optimal) tolerable deviation of the optimal objective function value and are of interest to managers and decision makers because they can address un-modelled objectives, preferences, limits, uncertainties, or issues that are not considered by the original optimization model or it's optimal solution. Mathematically, the region of near-optimal alternatives is defined by the constraints for the original optimization model as well as a constraint that limits alternatives to those with objective function values that are within a tolerable deviation of the optimal objective function value. The code and tools within this repository allow users to generate and visualize the structure and full extent of the near-optimal region to an optimization problem. The tools also allow users to interactively explore region features of most interest, streamline the process to elicit un-modelled issues, and update the model formulation with new information. The tools and their use are described here for generating, visualizing, and interactively exploring near-optimal alternatives to optimization problems, but the tools are general and can be used to generate and visualize points within any high-dimensional, closed, bounded region that can be defined by a system of constraints. The parallel coordinate visualization and several interaction tools can also be used for any high-dimensional data set. title is Blended Near Optimal Tools. creator is Rosenberg, David. author is Rosenberg, David. creator is Rosenberg, David. subject is linear program. subject is Echo Reservoir. subject is Utah. subject is Phosophorus removal. subject is Near-optimal. subject is Jordan. subject is Amman. subject is Parallel coordinate visualization. subject is mixed-integer program. subject is multi-objective program. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u'Population growth and socioeconomic changes in developing countries over the past few decades have created sever stress on the available water resources across the world, particularly in semiarid regions, such as Utah. Hence, the optimal management of water resources is imperative. This study aimed to explore opportunities to provide the optimal reservoir operation rules for the Hyrum Reservoir, located on the Little Bear River in Utah, considering the reliability and vulnerability as the objective functions. Solving the multi-objective (herein two-objective) problem contributed us to investigate the interaction between reliability and vulnerability in this project. Modified Firefly Algorithm (MFA) was implemented as the optimization tool and three different problems, namely (1) single objective problem with reliability as the objective function, (2) single objective problem with vulnerability as the objective function, and (3) multi-objective problem with reliability and vulnerability as the objective functions, were solved. The results demonstrate the trade-off between the two objectives in the multi-objective problem. It also manifest that considering a multi-objective problem provide solutions whose the reliability and vulnerability values are within the upper and lower ranges calculated in the single objective problems.title is Investigating the interaction between statistical indices for performance assessment of Hyrum Reservoir on Little Bear River in an optimization model. creator is Garousi-nejad, Irene. author is Garousi-nejad, Irene. creator is Garousi-nejad, Irene. subject is Resiliency. subject is Optimization. subject is Hyrum Reservoir. subject is Vulnerability. subject is Reliability. subject is CEE 6490. subject is Reservoir operation. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. coverage_type is box. format is application/pdf. format is image/gif. format is video/mp4. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Garousi-nejad, Irene.

 u'In this study, a platform has been developed to find the optimal coordinates of n-point hedging rule for an agricultural reservoir using the genetic algorithm (GA). This platform written in MATLAB can be modified for any agricultural reservoir considering different objective function. The Hyrum Reservoir as the agricultural reservoir in the Bear River system is considered as the case study and the platform is executed for different values for n-point (1, 5, 10, 20, and 40) under minimizing the vulnerability indicator. In addition, the values for vulnerability achieved by the GA are compared to the standard linear operation policy (SLOP). Results indicated that there are no differences between the optimal n-point hedging rule found by GA and the SLOP in terms of vulnerability. After analyzing the results, the author found that the water availability is more than the amount of demand related to the demand sites of the Hyrum reservoir in all period of the operation. In other words, there is a spill from the reservoir for all the period of operation. That\u2019s why the vulnerability for all n-point hedging rule achieved by the GA is similar to the vulnerability calculated based on the SLOP. Therefore, it is recommended that the operators of the Hyrum reservoir keep using the SLOP until there is a development in the agricultural field that leads to increasing the amount of the demand. In developing situation, they can run the platform to achieve the optimal n-point hedging rule in terms of minimizing the vulnerability or even other objective functions.title is CEE 6490- Project. creator is Aboutalebi, Mahyar. author is Aboutalebi, Mahyar. creator is Aboutalebi, Mahyar. subject is CEE 6490. organization is Utah State University. availability is private. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. format is application/pdf. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. format is video/mp4. format is application/rar. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Aboutalebi, Mahyar.

 u"This resource contains the final data files and R scripts used in our analysis of water use across two high-traffic, public restrooms on Utah State University's campus. We used an inexpensive, open source, water metering system that uses off-the-shelf electronic components and inexpensive analog meters to measure water use quantity and behavior at high temporal frequency (< 5 s). We demonstrated this technology in the two restrooms at Utah State University before and after installing high efficiency, automatic faucets and toilet flush valves. We also integrated an inexpensive sensor to count user traffic to the restrooms. Sensing and recording restroom visits and water use events at high frequency allowed us to monitor water use behavior and identify water fixture malfunctions, such as undesired leaks. Results also show average water use per person, variability in water use by different fixtures (faucets versus urinals and toilets), variability in water use by fixtures compared to manufacturer specifications, gender differences in water use, and the difference in water use related to retrofit of the restrooms with high efficiency fixtures. The inexpensive metering system can help institutions remotely measure and record water use trends and behavior, identify leaks and fixture malfunctions, and schedule fixture maintenance or upgrades based on their operation, all of which can ultimately help them meet goals for sustainable water use.title is Measuring Water Use, Conservation, and Differences by Gender  Using an Inexpensive, High Frequency Metering System. creator is Horsburgh, Jeffery. creator is Leonardo, Miguel E.. creator is Abdallah, Adel. creator is Rosenberg, David. author is Horsburgh, Jeffery. creator is Horsburgh, Jeffery. creator is Leonardo, Miguel E.. creator is Abdallah, Adel. creator is Rosenberg, David. subject is Smart Meter. subject is Water Use. organization is Utah State University. organization is Utah State University. organization is Utah State University. organization is Utah State University. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u"Forty-two water decision makers in cities in Utah were identified representing elected official positions as well as staff (e.g., public utilities, public works, etc.). Three valleys in the rapidly growing Northern Utah Wasatch Range Metropolitan Area (WRMA) are represented. In smaller cities where staff play multiple roles, those who performed some operations in water management were selected. Those selected for interviews were identified through city websites and, in a few cases, phone calls to city hall. Participants were contacted by email first and followed up telephone as needed. \r\nAll of the interviews were conducted in-person between November 2015 and July 2016. During this time, city elections complicated contact and identifying key informants. When able, we interviewed the incumbents. Only one potential respondent who had initially agreed to an interview canceled without follow-up, for a response rate of 97.6%. Interviews were audio-recorded and tended to last between 20 and 90 minutes each. Each interview was transcribed with the help of two transcribers and deductively coded for themes by a team of three using NVIVO 11 Pro. The team started with an a priori coding matrix based on the interview guide and allowed for additional themes to emerge through the revision of categories and the coding agenda, reaching inter-coder reliability (<80% kappa coefficient). The database in NVIVO titled CKI_project_TEAM contains 40 transcribed interviews. One interview was not coded due to irrelevance and the pilot interview was not coded. Interview 013 does not exist because the respondent canceled. Overall,  coders maintained a range of kappa coefficients with % minimum agreement. The final agreement measurements were calculated on Interview 38 which was coded by all three coders. High dual-coder agreement was also attained on the following interviews: 001, 003, 004, and 011. Coders met weekly to retain alignment in nodes and definitions (qualitative agreement). Coders were instructed to code every respondent sentence to the period (quantitative agreement). If the respondent's answer was short (e.g., Yes/No), the coder coded the interview question along with the answer to retain context.  Respondents were asked the following: 1) the one key water issue facing their city today; 2) if their city had an adequate water supply to meet their city\u2019s needs today, and 3) did they think their city had an adequate water supply to meet their city\u2019s needs in the future. \r\ntitle is Community Key Informant. creator is Haeffner, Melissa. creator is Flint, Courtney. creator is Jackson-smith, Douglas. author is Haeffner, Melissa. creator is Haeffner, Melissa. creator is Flint, Courtney. creator is Jackson-smith, Douglas. contributor is Ennea Fairchild. contributor is Kenley, Natalie Harker. contributor is Barnett, Matthew. subject is water issues. subject is water conservation. subject is public utilities. subject is water supply. subject is leader perspective. subject is water infrastructure. subject is cities. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u'This tutorial demonstrates implementation of the Cellular Automaton Tree-GRass-Shrub Simulator (CATGRaSS) [Zhou et al., 2013] on a flat domain. This model is built using components from the Landlab component library. CATGRaSS is spatially explicit model of plant coexistence. It simulates local ecohydrologic dynamics (soil moisture, transpiration, biomass) and spatial evolution of tree, grass, and shrub Plant Functional Types (PFT) driven by rainfall and solar radiation. \r\n\r\nEach cell in the model grid can hold a single PFT or remain empty. Tree and shrub plants disperse seeds to their neighbors. Grass seeds are assumed to be available at each cell. Establishment of plants in empty cells is determined probabilistically based on water stress of each PFT. Plants with lower water stress have higher probability of establishment. Plant mortality is simulated probabilistically as a result of aging and drought stress. Fires and grazing will be added to this model soon.  \r\n\r\nThis model (driver) contains:\r\n  - A local vegetation dynamics model that simulates storm and inter-storm water balance and ecohydrologic fluxes (ET, runoff), and plant biomass dynamics by coupling the following components:\r\n        - PrecipitationDistribution\r\n        - Radiation\r\n        - PotentialEvapotranspiration\r\n        - SoilMoisture\r\n        - Vegetation\r\n\r\n  - A spatially explicit probabilistic cellular automaton component that simulates plant competition by tracking establishment and mortality of plants based on soil moisture stress:\r\n        - VegCA\r\n    \r\nTo run this Jupyter notebook, please make sure that the following files are in the same folder:\r\n        - cellular_automaton_vegetation_flat_domain.ipynb (this notebook)\r\n        - Inputs_Vegetation_CA.txt (Input parameters for the model)\r\n        - Ecohyd_functions_flat.py (Utility functions)\r\n\r\n[Ref: Zhou, X, E.

 u'iUTAH researchers contacted municipal water provider organizations in the 12 cities represented in the 2014 household survey that maintain billing records or other water use records. Of the 12, 11 cities released data under a strict confidentiality agreement outlined in a memorandum of understanding to link water bills from months in 2014 to parcels or buildings where individual survey respondents were located. The water bills were matched to results from a 2014 household survey. Researchers at Utah State University and the University of Utah implemented the \u20182014 iUTAH Household Survey\u2019 with over 2,300 randomly selected households in 2014 in 23 neighborhoods in 12 Utah communities. The survey included detailed individual- and household-level information about water management behaviors, perceptions of water resource conditions, and attitudes toward a range of water policies and programs. \r\n\r\nThe survey research team leaders agreed to:\r\n\u2022\tTreat any water use or billing records with care and discretion and to respect the privacy rights of individual water system customers.\r\n\u2022\tAggregate the results of our analysis so that the historic water use levels and water bills of any individual customer, building or parcel are not released in any publicly accessible document, presentation, or report.\r\n\u2022\tNever share the detailed water use records with any other individual or group without the expressed written permission of the municipal water provider organization.\r\n\u2022\tEnsure that any person who has access to the raw individual-level survey and water use datasets have completed institutional review board human subjects research training, are currently certified and authorized to work with the data, and agree to the stringent confidentiality protocols listed above.\r\n\u2022\tNot reveal the specific location or identity of individual respondents to the 2014 iUTAH Household Survey to any other individual or organization, including the partner municipal water provider organization.\r\n\r\nThe municipal water provider organization representatives agreed to:\r\n\u2022\tProvide an electronic dataset of billing or water use records that permit a reliable estimate of actual rates of water consumption at the parcel or building scale.\r\n\u2022\tAddress, tax parcel, or other information that allows these records to be linked to the individual parcels, buildings, or customer addresses.\r\n\u2022\tNot require the research team to reveal to the municipal provider the identity of which specific parcels or households were either sampled into or responded to our survey.\r\n\r\nThe data cleaning process included the following steps:\r\na.\tCalculate monthly estimates\r\nb.\tCalculate per capita based on household size\r\nc.\tCalculate per acreage\r\nd.\tCalculate tiered cost\r\ne.\tMatch household survey responses with water bill data\r\ntitle is 2014 Utah Cities Water Use Data. creator is Jackson-smith, Douglas. creator is Haeffner, Melissa. author is Jackson-smith, Douglas. creator is Jackson-smith, Douglas. creator is Haeffner, Melissa. contributor is Ellison, Tanner. subject is bills. subject is Utah. subject is water use. subject is behavior. subject is water consumption. organization is Utah State University - Logan, UT. availability is private. coverage_type is box. coverage_type is period. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Haeffner, Melissa. owner is Jackson-smith, Douglas.

 u'iUTAH researchers have developed and deployed an ecohydrologic observatory to study water in \u2018Gradients Along Mountain to Urban Transitions\u2019 (GAMUT). The GAMUT Network measures aspects of climate, hydrology, and water quality along a mountain-to-urban gradient in three watersheds that share common water sources (winter-derived precipitation) but differ in the human and biophysical nature of land-use transitions. Designing GAMUT was a 12-month process involving faculty and technicians from across Utah\u2019s research-intensive institutions: Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, and Utah State University.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains raw data for all of the air temperature in degrees Celsius measured for the iUTAH GAMUT Network climate site near Beaver Divide.  \r\n\n\n[Modified in JupyterHub on 2017-03-30 21:26:49.372415]\nThis daily average air temperature for the Beaver Divide gauging station that is maintained by iUtah researchers.title is Daily Aggregate Temperature for Beaver Divide. creator is Li, Yi. author is Li, Yi. creator is Li, Yi. subject is iUtah. subject is Time Series. subject is Beaver Divide. subject is Temperatire. subject is Air Temperature. availability is private. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Li, Yi.

 u'This NOCA landslide data repository host the driver code and data files needed to run Landlab\'s LandslideProbability component, which models annual shallow landslide probability  in a steep mountainous region in northern Washington, U.S.A. The model application covers North Cascade National Park Complex (NOCA), using 30-m grid resolution over 2,700 km2.  The model use the classic infinite slope, limited equilibrium model driven by contemporary climatology from  the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model.  Readily available topographic, geophysical, and land cover data are provided to calculate the factor-of-safety stability index in a Monte Carlo simulation, which explicitly accounts for parameter uncertainty.\r\n\r\nData used for this analysis are spatial data on landscape characteristics for NOCA. They include soil, geology, vegetation, topography, and landform data that can be used for quantitative landslides hazard assessment. Elevation was acquired from National Elevation Dataset (NED) at 30 m grid scale; other datasets are matched to scale and location. Slope was derived from the elevation file as "tan theta". Specific contributing area represents the \'upstream\' area draining to each cell divided by the cell\'s width (so minimum value is 30 m). Landform data was developed by Jon Riedel of National Park Service. Landslides were extracted from these data identified as "mass wasting" events. Land use and land cover (LULC) data were acquired from USGS National land Cover Data (NLCD) based on 2011 Landsat satellite data and grouped into eight general categories.  Cohesion represent total cohesion, which is equivalent to root cohesion in this application; soils are assumed to be primarily cohesionless, lacking \u201ctrue cohesion\u201d because of their low clay content in this mountain terrain. Root cohesion is based on the LULC referenced to a look-up table within this resource: (https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/a771ba9bbae24ed8b4673c945fc321a3/). Soil depth comes from Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) maintained by NRCS processed as soil survey depth-to-restricted layer (weighted-average aggregation) within each soil map unit. An alternative modeled soil depth (SD) described in the accompany paper is also provided, but revisions in the driver notebook would be required to reference this file to see adjusted results.  Transmissivity was derived from the soil survey saturated hydraulic conductivity (depth averaged) multiplied by depth-to-restricted layer for each soil map unit; another T file based on the model soil depth is also provided.  However, the model can be run using hydraulic conductivity using data file provided to calculate T. All soils within this watershed are sandy loam or loamy sand; therefore, soil surface texture was used as an indicator of internal angle of friction (phi). A header file is provided to understand the spatial details of the ASCII files and to facilitate capability with GIS. Spatial reference for raster mapping is NAD_1983, Albers conical equal area projection.\r\n\r\nThe model run archived in this resource runs with Landlab version 1.1.0 .

In my PhD program, I am working on three distinct and novel research projects. In one of the components of my PhD research I assess the issues on different land management practices on water availability, with the main goal impact assessment and mitigation options on Wyoming agriculture including production agriculture and water resources. I am developing a user-friendly software that can be used by any stakeholder to determine agricultural management effects on water resources. The second component of my research is the creation of an environmental impact assessment (EIS) to investigate the impact of oil and gas production in Wyoming while recommending the oil and gas producers how to minimize the impacts of oil and gas on Environment and directly related to the impact criteria for natural resource management. This investigation can be used by producers to alter practices to minimize environmental impacts on future drilling to satisfy regulatory frameworks and maximize profits. The last component of my dissertation is to address and quantify water resource issues in the future (2050-2060) under anticipated climate change by linking future forecast models of potential climates to hydrologic models. This work is focused on rangeland and agricultural sustainability. \r\n\r\nOutside of my work I enjoy swimming, hiking. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to see you all.\r\ntitle is Crowcreek_homewatershed. creator is Vithanage, Jagath. author is Vithanage, Jagath. creator is Vithanage, Jagath. subject is SI2017_homewatershed. availability is public. coverage_type is box. format is application/cpg. format is application/dbf. format is application/prj. format is application/x-qgis. format is text/plain. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Geographic Feature (ESRI Shapefiles). owner is Vithanage, Jagath. geometry_type is POLYGON. field_name is Name. field_type is String. field_type_code is 4.

 u"[[Extended model description::ANUGA is a hydrodynamic model for simulating depth-averaged flows over 2D surfaces. This package adds two new modules (operators) to ANUGA. These are appropriate for reach-scale simulations of flows on mobile-bed streams with spatially extensive floodplain vegetation.\nThe mathematical framework for the sediment transport operator is described in Simpson and Castelltort [2006] and Davy and Lague [2009]. This operator calculates an explicit sediment mass balance within the water column at every cell in order to handle the local disequilibria between entrainment and deposition that arise due to strong spatial variability in shear stress in complex flows.\nThe vegetation drag operator uses the mathematical approach of Nepf [1999] and Kean and Smith [2006], treating vegetation as arrays of objects (cylinders) that the flow must go around. Compared to methods that simulate the increased roughness of vegetation with a modified Manning's n, this method better accounts for the effects of drag on the body of the flow and the quantifiable differences between vegetation types and densities (as stem diameter and stem spacing). This operator can simulate uniform vegetation as well as spatially-varied vegetation across the domain. The vegetation drag module also accounts for the effects of vegetation on turbulent and mechanical diffusivity, following the equations in Nepf [1997, 1999].]]title is AnugaSed. creator is Perignon, Mariela. author is Perignon, Mariela. creator is Perignon, Mariela. subject is sediment transport, \nvegetation, \nflood,. organization is University of Colorado - CSDMS. availability is private. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Sadler, Jeff. owner is Morgan, Edward.

 u'Hydrological Simulation Program - FORTRAN (HSPF) is a comprehensive package\nfor simulation of watershed hydrology and water quality for both conventional\nand toxic organic pollutants (1,2).  This model can simulate the hydrologic,\nand associated water quality, processes on pervious and impervious land\nsurfaces and in streams and well-mixed impoundments.  HSPF incorporates the\nwatershed-scale ARM and NPS models into a basin-scale analysis framework that\nincludes fate and transport in one-dimensional stream channels.  It is the\nonly comprehensive model of watershed hydrology and water quality that allows\nthe integrated simulation of land and soil contaminant runoff processes with\nin-stream hydraulic and sediment-chemical interactions.\nThe result of this simulation is a time history of the runoff flow rate,\nsediment load, and nutrient and pesticide concentrations, along with a time\nhistory of water quantity and quality at any point in a watershed.  HSPF\nsimulates three sediment types (sand, silt, and clay) in addition to a single\norganic chemical and transformation products of that chemical.  The transfer\nand reaction processes included are hydrolysis, oxidation, photolysis,\nbiodegradation, volatilization, and sorption.  Sorption is modeled as a\nfirst-order kinetic process in which the user must specify a desorption rate\nand an equilibrium partition coefficient for each of the three solids types.\nResuspension and settling of silts and clays (cohesive solids) are defined in\nterms of shear stress at the sediment water interface.  The capacity of the\nsystem to transport sand at a particular flow is calculated and resuspension\nor settling is defined by the difference between the sand in suspension and\nthe transport capacity.  Calibration of the model requires data for each of\nthe three solids types.  Benthic exchange is modeled as sorption/desorption\nand deposition/scour with surficial benthic sediments.

 u"LOAD ESTimator (LOADEST) is a FORTRAN program for estimating constituent loads in streams and rivers. Given a time series of streamflow, additional data variables, and constituent concentration, LOADEST assists the user in developing a regression model for the estimation of constituent load (calibration). Explanatory variables within the regression model include various functions of streamflow, decimal time, and additional user-specified data variables. The formulated regression model then is used to estimate loads over a user-specified time interval (estimation). Mean load estimates, standard errors, and 95 percent confidence intervals are developed on a monthly and(or) seasonal basis.\nThe calibration and estimation procedures within LOADEST are based on three statistical estimation methods. The first two methods, Adjusted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (AMLE) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), are appropriate when the calibration model errors (residuals) are normally distributed. Of the two, AMLE is the method of choice when the calibration data set (time series of streamflow, additional data variables, and concentration) contains censored data. The third method, Least Absolute Deviation (LAD), is an alternative to maximum likelihood estimation when the residuals are not normally distributed. LOADEST output includes diagnostic tests and warnings to assist the user in determining the appropriate estimation method and in interpreting the estimated loads.\nThe LOADEST software and related materials (data and documentation) are made available by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to be used in the public interest and the advancement of science.

 u'MODFLOW is a three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water model that was first published in 1984. It has a modular structure that allows it to be easily modified to adapt the code for a particular application.  Many new capabilities have been added to the original model.  OFR 00-92 (complete reference below) documents a general update to MODFLOW, which is called MODFLOW-2000 in order to distinguish it from earlier versions.\nMODFLOW-2000 simulates steady and nonsteady flow in an irregularly shaped flow system in which aquifer layers can be confined, unconfined, or a combination of confined and unconfined. Flow from external stresses, such as flow to wells, areal recharge, evapotranspiration, flow to drains, and flow through river beds, can be simulated. Hydraulic conductivities or transmissivities for any layer may differ spatially and be anisotropic (restricted to having the principal directions aligned with the grid axes), and the storage coefficient may be heterogeneous. Specified head and specified flux boundaries can be simulated as can a head dependent flux across the model\'s outer boundary that allows water to be supplied to a boundary block in the modeled area at a rate proportional to the current head difference between a "source" of water outside the modeled area and the boundary block.  MODFLOW is currently the most used numerical model in the U.S. Geological Survey for ground-water flow problems.\nIn addition to simulating ground-water flow, the scope of MODFLOW-2000 has been expanded to incorporate related capabilities such as solute transport and parameter estimation.title is MODFLOW. creator is Barlow, Paul. creator is Harbaugh, Arlen. creator is Banta, Edward. creator is Hill, Mary. creator is Winston, Richard. author is Barlow, Paul. creator is Barlow, Paul. creator is Harbaugh, Arlen. creator is Banta, Edward. creator is Hill, Mary. creator is Winston, Richard. subject is basins,. organization is U.S. Geological Survey. availability is private. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Morgan, Edward. owner is Sadler, Jeff.

 u'One-Dimensional Transport with Equilibrium Chemistry (OTEQ):\nA Reactive Transport Model for Streams and Rivers\nOTEQ is a mathematical simulation model used to characterize the fate and transport of waterborne solutes in streams and rivers. The model is formed by coupling a solute transport model with a chemical equilibrium submodel. The solute transport model is based on OTIS, a model that considers the physical processes of advection, dispersion, lateral inflow, and transient storage. The equilibrium submodel is based on MINTEQ, a model that considers the speciation and complexation of aqueous species, acid-base reactions, precipitation/dissolution, and sorption.\nWithin OTEQ, reactions in the water column may result in the formation of solid phases (precipitates and sorbed species) that are subject to downstream transport and settling processes. Solid phases on the streambed may also interact with the water column through dissolution and sorption/desorption reactions. Consideration of both mobile (waterborne) and immobile (streambed) solid phases requires a unique set of governing differential equations and solution techniques that are developed herein. The partial differential equations describing physical transport and the algebraic equations describing chemical equilibria are coupled using the sequential iteration approach. The model\'s ability to simulate pH, precipitation/dissolution, and pH-dependent sorption provides a means of evaluating the complex interactions between instream chemistry and hydrologic transport at the field scale.\nOTEQ is generally applicable to solutes which undergo reactions that are sufficiently fast relative to hydrologic processes ("Local Equilibrium"). Although the definition of "sufficiently fast" is highly solute and application dependent, many reactions involving inorganic solutes quickly reach a state of chemical equilibrium. Given a state of chemical equilibrium, inorganic solutes may be modeled using OTEQ\'s equilibrium approach. This equilibrium approach is facilitated through the use of an existing database that describes chemical equilibria for a wide range of inorganic solutes. In addition, solute reactions not included in the existing database may be added by defining the appropriate mass-action equations and the associated equilibrium constants. As such, OTEQ provides a general framework for the modeling of solutes under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. Despite this generality, most OTEQ applications to date have focused on the transport of metals in streams and small rivers. The OTEQ documentation is therefore focused on metal transport. Potential model users should note, however, that additional applications are possible.title is OTEQ. creator is Runkel, Rob. author is Runkel, Rob. creator is Runkel, Rob. subject is biogeochemistry, \nwater quality,. organization is USGS. availability is private. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Morgan, Edward. owner is Sadler, Jeff.

 u'One-Dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage (OTIS): A Solute Transport Model for Streams and Rivers\nOTIS is a mathematical simulation model used to characterize the fate and transport of water-borne solutes in streams and rivers. The governing equation underlying the model is the advection-dispersion equation with additional terms to account for transient storage, lateral inflow, first-order decay, and sorption. This equation and the associated equations describing transient storage and sorption are solved using a Crank-Nicolson finite-difference solution.\nOTIS may be used in conjunction with data from field-scale tracer experiments to quantify the hydrologic parameters affecting solute transport. This application typically involves a trial-and-error approach wherein parameter estimates are adjusted to obtain an acceptable match between simulated and observed tracer concentrations. Additional applications include analyses of nonconservative solutes that are subject to sorption processes or first-order decay. OTIS-P, a modified version of OTIS, couples the solution of the governing equation with a nonlinear regression package. OTIS-P determines an optimal set of parameter estimates that minimize the squared differences between the simulated and observed concentrations, thereby automating the parameter estimation process.title is OTIS. creator is Runkel, Rob. author is Runkel, Rob. creator is Runkel, Rob. subject is biogeochemistry, \nwater quality,. organization is USGS. availability is private. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Sadler, Jeff. owner is Morgan, Edward.

 u'SPARROW (SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes) is a watershed modeling technique for relating water-quality measurements made at a network of monitoring stations to attributes of the watersheds containing the stations. The core of the model consists of a nonlinear regression equation describing the non-conservative transport of contaminants from point and diffuse sources on land to rivers and through the stream and river network. The model predicts contaminant flux, concentration, and yield in streams and has been used to evaluate alternative hypotheses about the important contaminant sources and watershed properties that control transport over large spatial scales.title is SPARROW. creator is Alexander, Richard. creator is Preston, Steve. creator is Schwarz, Gregory. creator is Smith, Richard. author is Alexander, Richard. creator is Alexander, Richard. creator is Preston, Steve. creator is Schwarz, Gregory. creator is Smith, Richard. subject is biogeochemistry, \nwater quality,. organization is USGS, NAWQA Hydrologic Systems Team. availability is private. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Morgan, Edward. owner is Sadler, Jeff.

 u"The Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snow model is an energy balance snowmelt model developed by David Tarboton's research group, first in 1994, and updated over the years. The model uses a lumped representation of the snowpack and keeps track of water and energy balance. The model is driven by inputs of air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity and radiation at time steps sufficient to resolve the diurnal cycle (six hours or less). The model uses physically-based calculations of radiative, sensible, latent and advective heat exchanges. A force-restore approach is used to represent surface temperature, accounting for differences between snow surface temperature and average snowpack temperature without having to introduce additional state variables. Melt outflow is a function of the liquid fraction, using Darcy's law. This allows the model to account for continued outflow even when the energy balance is negative. Because of its parsimony (few state variables - but increasing with later versions) this model is suitable for application in a distributed fashion on a grid over a watershed.title is UEB. creator is Gupta, Avirup Sen. creator is Tarboton, David. author is Gupta, Avirup Sen. creator is Gupta, Avirup Sen. creator is Tarboton, David. subject is snow dynamics, \nglacial melt,. organization is Utah State University. availability is private. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. format is application/md. format is text/plain. format is application/f90. format is application/x-netcdf. format is application/dat. format is application/vfproj. format is application/sln. format is application/log. format is application/gfortran. format is application/ifort. format is application/common. format is application/Dat. format is application/x-msdos-program. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Sadler, Jeff. owner is Morgan, Edward.

 u'I am a civil engineering graduate with comprehensive understanding of hydraulic analysis and techniques for water resources; I am passionate about understanding the tentative water resource planning, management and operation decision making in a large and complex drainage systems. My six years of study and my summer practical field work experience has instilled the need for me to understand and further pursue water resource management as a career choice for me. I am now looking forward to a career focused implementation of these systems for the environment and presenting opportunities to work with other people of whom share these interest.\r\nI am a reliable person, have great communication skills in both English and Spanish, I am responsible and friendly, all of which I plan to bring along to any project. I have experience in project management, strong organizational and administrative skills with the ability to work independently and use my own initiative. I have specific experience in research, data collection and analysis.\r\nI am able to work in a multi-cultural team and adapt to new cultures. My previous positions have involved working with other workers from different backgrounds; from which, if any, miscommunication would occur, I have experience working through them with the other workers. I have also experienced the work needed in remote areas often under difficult conditions of physical fieldwork that needed extended research. Overall my skills in environmental science, hydrology, conservation, and resource management and commitment to the job are part of my endeavor to complete any objective that is brought in front of me. \r\nyou can contact me at jose.o.gonzalez01@utrgv.edu\r\ntitle is jGonzalez_homewatershed. creator is Gonzalez, Jose. author is Gonzalez, Jose. creator is Gonzalez, Jose. subject is SI2017_homewatershed. availability is private. format is application/rar. format is application/xml. format is application/x-qgis. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Gonzalez, Jose.

 u'This dataset is part of a project assessing the impacts of wildfires on the water balance of the Illilouette Creek Basin in Yosemite National Park. Three weather stations were mounted on poles in an area that had burned under various severities in 2004. Each station is located in a distinct vegetation type: closed canopy mixed conifer, shrubfield (dominated by Ceanothus cordulatus), and a wetland. Each weather station has at least two time lapse cameras capturing images four times per day. These images were used to calculate the depth of snow by comparing the height of the snowpack against the weather station pole or a nearby tree to known heights along the pole or tree. Measurements from different cameras at the same station may differ slightly from each other if snow piles up against the side of a pole, or if snow melts preferentially near a pole, but these differences are small compared to the maximum depths of snow. The data shows that peak snowpack was deepest at the wetland site, and shallowest under the closed canopy. Spring snowmelt also finished earliest in the closed canopy site.\r\n title is Illilouette Creek Basin Snow Depth Time Series. creator is Boisrame, Gabrielle. author is Boisrame, Gabrielle. creator is Boisrame, Gabrielle. subject is Fire. subject is Illilouette. subject is Snow. subject is Yosemite. availability is private. coverage_type is period. coverage_type is point. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Boisrame, Gabrielle. owner is Ekaterina Rakhmatulina.

 u'iUTAH researchers have developed and deployed an ecohydrologic observatory to study water in \u2018Gradients Along Mountain to Urban Transitions\u2019 (GAMUT). The GAMUT Network measures aspects of climate, hydrology, and water quality along a mountain-to-urban gradient in three watersheds that share common water sources (winter-derived precipitation) but differ in the human and biophysical nature of land-use transitions.

 u'Generating estimates of daily reference photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR). We show the procedure to generate estimates of daily reference PAR using solar radiation data. The input for the R script (CalculateDailyPAR.R) is a raw time series of hourly solar radiation (stored in variable \u2018ws\u2019) that for our case was obtained from the CIMIS website (station id: 105) [California Department of Water Resources, 2015]. The script processes the data set to format the date and time columns, and to identify missing data points reporting their position within the time series (variable \u2018na.id\u2019). The user fills the gaps using adequate strategies and creates a new input file (stored in variable \u2018fill.points\u2019) containing the values to fill in within the time series. A reference PAR estimate is obtained as a constant fraction of solar radiation using the conversion factor proposed by [Meek et al., 1984]. The script then calculates an average daily value of solar radiation and integrates the reference PAR over the daytime period to obtain a daily value. The script ends by generating a final table (\u2018ws.results\u2019) reporting daily values of solar radiation (maximum and mean in W m-2), and maximum, mean, and minimum reference PAR values in units of (\u03bcmol m-2 d-1) and (mol m-2 d-1).\r\nDOI:10.6084/m9.figshare.3412765title is R script to calculate daily PAR from solar radiation data. creator is Villamizar, Sandra. author is Villamizar, Sandra. creator is Villamizar, Sandra. subject is R script. subject is Solar Radiation. subject is Photosynthetically Active Radiation. organization is Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Bucaramanga. availability is private. format is application/R. format is text/csv. format is text/plain. format is image/png. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. source is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/29c5ce6c1f3146538d252bc15ad5a976. relation is https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/885906ef97e542a8a33048ea486ddfdf/. resource_type is Generic. owner is Moody, Alex.

 u"Assessment of ecosystem \u2018health\u2019 traditionally uses structural indicators (e.g., biotic community composition) but often neglects indicators of ecosystem processes (e.g., decomposition rates), providing an incomplete picture of overall ecosystem condition. Efforts to establish a framework identifying thresholds of organic matter decomposition expected in relatively intact, moderately degraded, and severely degraded ecosystems have been stymied by limited geographic scope and variation in organic matter composition that preclude general use of the framework. The goal of the CELLulose Decomposition ExXperiment (CELLDEX) project is to compare riparian and in-stream organic matter decomposition rates (i.e., loss of tensile strength per unit time) across all of the Earth's major biomes using a standardized cotton strip assay.\xa0Using a \u2018crowdsourcing\u2019 approach with researchers from over 40 countries, CELLDEX involves the deployment of a standardized substrate assay in approximately 400 streams and their riparian zones, representing each of Earth\u2019s major biomes, and spanning 140 degrees of latitude.  Each partner is responsible for incubating standardized cotton strips in four reference streams for ~ 30 days near their home institutions and provide ancillary data on water temperature and chemistry. This simple, inexpensive assay omits intrinsic differences in organic matter (i.e., variation in chemical composition and physical structure), thus allowing the influence of extrinsic environmental factors (e.g., temperature, water chemistry, flow or precipitation regimes) to be better assessed. This assay also is sensitive to differences in environmental conditions at regional and watershed scales, including those associated with environmental degradation. Cellulose strips were deployed for approximately 30 days from mid-October to mid-November in four streams and adjacent riparian zones in central Utah, USA to measure rates of decomposition.

 u'HydroShare is an online, collaboration system for sharing hydrologic data, analytical tools, and models.  It supports the sharing of and collaboration around \u201cresources\u201d which are defined by standardized content types for data formats and models commonly used in hydrology.  Currently, with HydroShare you can: share your data and models with colleagues; manage who has access to the content that you share; share, access, visualize, and manipulate a broad set of hydrologic data types and models; publish data and models and obtain a citable digital object identifier (DOI); aggregate your resources into collections; discover and access data and models published by others; use the web services application programming interface (API) to programmatically  access resources; and use integrated web applications to visualize, analyze and run models on data in HydroShare.  Composite resources allow multiple file types from a study to be combined together, providing, as a single resource, an aggregation of all the data elements associated with a model or study. Hydroshare\u2019s composite resource construct can be used to support software that enables transparency and reproducibility, and thereby enhance trust in the research findings. Toward this, as part of the EarthCube GeoTrust project we are investigating how the composite resource construct can be extended to support transparency and reproducibility. The EarthCube GeoTrust project is creating \u201cgeounits\u201d which are self-contained packages of computational experiments that can be guaranteed to repeat or reproduce regardless of deployment issues. Since geounits provide a complete description of all the data elements with an instance (run) of a computational experiment, including input files, parameter files, the model executable, associated libraries, and output files produced, they can be mapped to a specialization of HydroShare\u2019s composite resource type. This has a direct effect of transforming HydroShare into a repository of geounits, and making published and cited experiments not only accessible but also reproducible, thereby enhancing trust in them. Tools that create geounits use HydroShare\u2019s REST API to load them into HydroShare, where they can then be shared with other users and downloaded for reproduction of the computational experiment, or further research with additional or alternate data.  This presentation will describe the functionality and architecture of HydroShare that enables the creation of geounits comprising: (1) resource storage, (2) resource exploration, and (3) actions on resources by web applications. HydroShare\u2019s components are loosely coupled and interact through APIs, which enhances robustness, as components can be upgraded and advanced relatively independently. The full power of this paradigm is the extensibility it supports, in that anybody can develop a web application that interacts with resources stored in HydroShare.  We welcome discussion of the opportunities this enables for interoperability with other EarthCube tools, to the benefit of the geoscience research community.title is HydroShare: A Platform for Collaborative Data and Model Sharing in Hydrology. creator is Tarboton, David. author is Tarboton, David. creator is Tarboton, David. subject is Earthcube. subject is 2017ECAHM. organization is Utah State University. organization is The HydroShare Team. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Tarboton, David. extra is Presentation: Poster for presentation at Earthcube all hands meeting, June 7, 2017.

However, creating a new model can demand a large investment of time, expert software skills, and can be constrained to adapting existing models with limited flexibility to address new questions.  Advancing the state of knowledge includes not only experimentation and publication, but also communication and distribution of large, and complex models and datasets.  Landlab is an open-source modeling toolkit for building, coupling, and exploring two-dimensional numerical models.  HydroShare is an online collaborative environment for sharing data and models.  Together, Landlab on HydroShare accelerates the development of new process models by providing (1) a set of tools for regular and irregular grid structures, data manipulation and visualization to make it faster and easier to develop new physical process components, (2) a suite of modular and interoperable process components that can be combined to create an integrated model; (3) cyber infrastructure that provides collaboration functions with multiple levels of sharing and privacy settings, Creative Commons license options, and DOI publishing, and 4) cloud access with high-speed processing from the CyberGIS HydroShare JupyterHub server at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.  New users can run models from a web browser, while advanced users can execute and develop models from command line terminals.  Landlab on HydroShare supports the modeling continuum from fully developed modelling applications, prototyping new science tools, hands on research demonstrations, and classroom applications.  The HydroShare-Landlab building block in EarthCube is a model of technology collaboration and tool exchange in the geoscience modeling community.title is Reproducible Earth-surface modeling with Landlab on HydroShare. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Castronova, Anthony Michael. creator is Phuong, Jimmy. creator is Strauch, Ronda. creator is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. creator is Sai Siddhartha Nudurupati. creator is Tarboton, David. creator is Yin, Dandong. creator is Wang, Shaowen. creator is Barnhart, Katherine. creator is Tucker, Greg. creator is Hutton, Eric. creator is Hobley, Daniel. creator is Gasparini, Nicole. creator is Adams, Jordan. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Castronova, Anthony Michael. creator is Phuong, Jimmy. creator is Strauch, Ronda. creator is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. creator is Sai Siddhartha Nudurupati. creator is Tarboton, David. creator is Yin, Dandong. creator is Wang, Shaowen. creator is Barnhart, Katherine. creator is Tucker, Greg. creator is Hutton, Eric. creator is Hobley, Daniel. creator is Gasparini, Nicole. creator is Adams, Jordan. subject is poster. subject is cyberGIS. subject is landlab. subject is observatory. subject is earthcube. organization is University of Washington. organization is CUAHSI. organization is University of Washington. organization is University of Washington. organization is University of Washington. organization is University of Washington - Seattle. organization is Utah State University. organization is University of Colorado at Boulder. organization is Tulane University. organization is Tulane University. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u'Erosion, transport and deposition of riverine suspended load are pivotal processes in the terrestrial carbon cycle and function of the critical zone. In order to better understand the response of these drivers to changes in land cover and climate, it is critical to characterize these drivers. In montane rivers, such as the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico, extreme storm events erode and transport clastic and organic material from mountain slopes to rivers, dominating annual export. Riverine particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate nitrogen (PN) exports are not as well understood, especially at high runoff rates. Over 25 years, river POC export was 75\xb120 tC km-2 yr-1 for Rio Icacos and 22\xb18 tC km-2 yr-1 for the Mameyes. Caribbean river POC yields were higher in relation to their SS yields, suggesting that these rivers have greater terrestrial OM supply on the landscape to be eroded and transported into rivers, than what is expected based on data for world rivers. Additionally, we determined that 50% of the suspended load flux occurred during extreme rainfall events, spanning just over 2 days a year, but only exporting <10% of the annual runoff and rainfall.  These results emphasize the important role of extreme rainfall events as drivers of POM export from the Luquillo Mountains.title is Extreme storms drive riverine particulate organic matter export from tropical mountians of estern Puerto Rico. creator is Clark, Kathryn E. creator is Stallard, Robert. creator is Scholl, Martha. creator is Plante, Alain F.. creator is Murphy, Sheila F.. creator is Gonzalez, Grizelle. creator is Mcdowell, William H.. author is Clark, Kathryn E. creator is Clark, Kathryn E. creator is Stallard, Robert. creator is Scholl, Martha. creator is Plante, Alain F.. creator is Murphy, Sheila F.. creator is Gonzalez, Grizelle. creator is Mcdowell, William H.. subject is rainfall. subject is suspended sediment. subject is hydrology. subject is LCZO. subject is Luquillo CZO. subject is Luquillo. subject is Puerto Rico. subject is biogeochemistry. subject is particulate organic carbon. subject is extreme events. organization is University of Pennsylvania. organization is USGS. organization is USGS. organization is University of Pennslyvania. organization is USGS. organization is USFS. organization is University of New Hampshire. availability is discoverable. coverage_type is box. coverage_type is period. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. format is application/zip. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Leon, Miguel. owner is Clark, Kathryn. extra is MAM_Ylds_SCN_particulates: 1991 to 2015 yields of runoff, SS, POC, and PN using LOADEst. extra is ICA_Ylds_SCN_problem_data_particulates: 1991 to 2015 yields of runoff, SS, POC, and PN using LOADEst. extra is ICA_Storms_particulate, MAM_Storms_particulate - Excel: n = 127 with > 80 mm rainfall / event and the flux of rainfall, runoff, SS, POC, and PN. extra is ICA_GAGE_YEARS, MAM_GAGE_YEARS - zip and text files: gap filled 1991 to 2014 instantaneous discharge, original data found online. extra is Events_Icacos_data - Excel: > 0.16 mm rainfall / event at Rio Icacos rain gauge, published: 10.1002/2013WR014413. extra is PR_SS_POC_PN - Excel: n = 2489 SS mg/L samples collected using ISCOs during storm events from 1991 to 2004,\n\nn = 1793 SS mg/L samples collected weekly from 1989 to 2015,\n\nn = 302 results of C%, N%, POC & PN mg/L, C/N.

 u'The EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is a dynamic rainfall-runoff simulation model used for single event or long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas. The runoff component of SWMM operates on a collection of subcatchment areas on which rain falls and runoff is generated. The routing portion of SWMM transports this runoff through a conveyance system of pipes, channels, storage/treatment devices, pumps, and regulators. SWMM tracks the quantity and quality of runoff generated within each subcatchment, and the flow rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period comprised of multiple time steps. SWMM was first developed back in 1971 and has undergone several major upgrades since then. The current edition, Version 5, is a complete re-write of the previous release. Running under Windows, EPA SWMM 5 provides an integrated environment for editing drainage area input data, running hydraulic and water quality simulations, and viewing the results in a variety of formats. These include color-coded drainage area maps, time series graphs and tables, profile plots, and statistical frequency analyses.title is Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). creator is Rossman, Lewis. creator is Schade, Trent. creator is Sullivan, Daniel. creator is Dickinson, Robert. creator is Chan, Carl. creator is Burgess, Edward. author is Rossman, Lewis. creator is Rossman, Lewis. creator is Schade, Trent. creator is Sullivan, Daniel. creator is Dickinson, Robert. creator is Chan, Carl. creator is Burgess, Edward. contributor is Gregory, Michael. contributor is Lai, Dennis. contributor is Huber, Wayne. subject is Hydrology. subject is Continuous. subject is Watershed. subject is Rainfall-Runoff. subject is Model. subject is Event-Based. organization is United States Environmental Protection Agency. organization is United States Environmental Protection Agency. organization is United States Environmental Protection Agency. organization is Camp Dresser & McKee Inc.. organization is Camp Dresser & McKee Inc.. organization is Camp Dresser & McKee Inc.. availability is public. format is application/zip. format is application/x-msdos-program. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is http://www2.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Morsy, Mohamed. owner is Castronova, Anthony.

 u'Climate change will affect global temperatures and the distribution and amount of precipitation, which are expected to impact regional hydrology and water resources in many parts of the world. It is therefore vital to quantify characteristics of the change and the corresponding uncertainty. A substantial amount of recent research has relied on climate projections obtained with General Circulation Models (GCMs) to assess climate change. However, such modeling results typically carry biases that must be reduced in some optimal fashion before any conclusions about robustness of climate change can be drawn. To minimize model- and scenario-specific biases, we combined information provided by the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project database with a Bayesian Weighted Averaging method. Specifically, the results of 18 GCMs for two emission scenarios RCP45 and RCP85 were downscaled for mid- (2041\u20132070) and end-century (2071\u20132100) intervals, at six WebMET locations that represent a hydroclimatic transect of Michigan. Furthermore, hourly results of future climate are generated by an advanced weather generator using the information from the combine GCMs ensemble.  title is Downscaled_CMIP5_Temperature_Precipitation_Projections_over_a_hydroclimaic_transect_of_Michigan. creator is Xu, Donghui. author is Xu, Donghui. creator is Xu, Donghui. subject is precipitation projections. subject is stochastic downscaling. subject is climate change. subject is uncertainty. subject is CMIP5. subject is weather generator. subject is factor of change. availability is public. format is application/mat. format is text/plain. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Xu, Donghui.

 u'Hydrologic extremes, such as drought, offer an exceptional opportunity to explore how runoff generation mechanisms and stream networks respond to changing precipitation regimes. The winter of 2014-2015 was the warmest on record in western Oregon, US, with record low snowpacks, and was followed by an anomalously warm, dry spring, resulting in historically low streamflows. But a year like 2015 is more than an outlier meteorological year. It provides a unique opportunity to test fundamental hypotheses for how montane hydrologic systems will respond to anticipated changes in amount and timing of recharge.  In particular, the volcanic Cascade Mountains represent a \u201clandscape laboratory\u201d comprised of two distinct runoff regimes:  the surface-flow dominated Western Cascade watersheds, with flashy streamflow regimes, rapid baseflow recession, and very low summer flows; and (b) the spring-fed High Cascade watersheds, with a slow-responding streamflow regime, and a long and sustained baseflow recession that maintains late summer streamflow through deep-groundwater contributions to high volume, coldwater springs.\r\nWe hypothesize that stream network response to the extremely low snowpack and subsequent recharge varies sharply in these two regions.  In surface flow dominated streams, the location of channel heads can migrate downstream, contracting the network longitudinally; the wetted channel width and depth contract laterally as summer recession proceeds and flows diminish. In contrast, in spring-fed streams, channel heads \u201cjump\u201d to the next downstream spring when upper basin spring flow diminishes to zero. Downstream of flowing springs, wetted channel width and depth contract laterally as flows recede. \r\nTo test these hypotheses, we conducted a field campaign to measure changing discharge, hydraulic geometry, and channel head location in both types of watersheds throughout the summer and early fall.  Multiple cross-section sites were established on 6 streams representing both flow regime types on either side of the Cascade crest.   In addition we took Isotopic water samples to determine recharge elevations of receding streams.  Taken together these measurements reveal the processes by which drainage networks contract as flows diminish \u2013 a fundamental property of montane stream systems both now and in the future.  \r\ntitle is No Snow No Flow - The 2015 Snow Drought in the Oregon Cascades. creator is Lewis, Sarah. author is Lewis, Sarah. creator is Lewis, Sarah. subject is Drought. availability is private. coverage_type is period. format is application/pdf. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Lewis, Sarah.

 u'Accurate assessment of erosion rates remains an elusive problem because soil loss is strongly nonunique with respect to the main drivers. In addressing the mechanistic causes of erosion responses, we discriminate between macroscale effects of external factors\u2014long studied and referred to as \u201cgeomorphic external variability\u201d, and microscale effects, introduced as \u201cgeomorphic internal variability.\u201d The latter source of erosion variations represents the knowledge gap, an overlooked but vital element of geomorphic response, significantly impacting the low predictability skill of deterministic models at field-catchment scales. This is corroborated with experiments using a comprehensive physical model that dynamically updates the soil mass and particle composition. As complete knowledge of microscale conditions for arbitrary location and time is infeasible, we propose that new predictive frameworks of soil erosion should embed stochastic components in deterministic assessments of external and internal types of geomorphic variability.title is Soil erosion assessmentMind the gap. creator is Xu, Donghui. creator is Kim, Jongho. author is Xu, Donghui. creator is Xu, Donghui. creator is Kim, Jongho. subject is rainfall detachment. subject is antecedent conditions. subject is catchment scale. subject is climate change. subject is land use. subject is water erosion. subject is model. subject is sediment yield. subject is overland flow. subject is interrill erosion. organization is University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. organization is Sejong University, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. availability is public. format is application/mat. format is text/plain. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Xu, Donghui.

 u'Presentation given to IAHS Scientific Assembly in Port Elizabeth, July 14, 2017\r\n\r\nResearchers around the world expend tremendous resources to gather and analyze vast stores of hydrologic data and use them in a myriad of hydrologic models.  The goal of HydroShare is to advance hydrologic science by enabling the scientific community to more easily and freely share products resulting from their research, not just the scientific publication summarizing a study, but also the data and models used to create the scientific publication.  HydroShare is a web-based hydrologic information system developed with the goal of sharing, accessing and discovering hydrologic data and models with specific functionality aimed at making collaboration easier and supporting reproducibility, and thus trust in research results.  HydroShare has been developed with U.S. National Science Foundation support under the auspices of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) to support the collaboration and community cyberinfrastructure needs of the hydrology research community.  Within HydroShare, we have developed new functionality for creating datasets, describing them with metadata, and sharing them with collaborators. We cast hydrologic datasets and models as \u201csocial objects\u201d that can be shared, collaborated around, annotated, published and discovered.  In addition to data and model sharing, HydroShare supports web application programs (apps) that can act on data stored in HydroShare, just as software programs on your PC act on your data locally.  This can free you from some of the limitations of local computing capacity and challenges in installing and maintaining software on your own PC.  HydroShare\u2019s web-based cyberinfrastructure can take work off your desk or laptop computer and onto infrastructure or "cloud" based data and processing servers.  This presentation will describe HydroShare\u2019s collaboration functionality that enables both public and private sharing with individual users and collaborative user groups, and makes it easier for collaborators to iterate on shared datasets and models, creating multiple versions along the way, and publishing them with a permanent landing page, metadata description, and citable Digital Object Identifier (DOI) when the work is complete. This presentation will also describe the web app architecture that supports interoperability with third party servers functioning as application engines for analysis and processing of big hydrologic datasets. title is Data and Models as Social Objects in the HydroShare System for Collaboration in the Hydrology Community. creator is Tarboton, David. author is Tarboton, David. creator is Tarboton, David. subject is Presentation. subject is IAHS. subject is IAHS2017. organization is Utah State University. organization is The HydroShare Team. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Tarboton, David.

 u'This data set contains measurements for discharge in cfs and cms, stream temperature in \xb0C , dissolved oxygen (DO) in mg/L and %/L, total dissolved solids (TDS) in \xb5s/cm, pebble count, and geomorphic condition, at sites in the Weber River Basin and Bear River Basin. Discharge was measured using a Marsh McBurney hand-held flowmeter. DO, TDS, and stream temperature were measured using a YSI Pro 2030 water quality probe. Pebble count was conducted using a modified Wolman procedure where a random pebble is picked up every step diagonally across a stream in a zig-zag pattern until at least 100 pebbles are measured. The pebble is then measured to obtain size and recorded.  Geomorphic condition was assessed visually by taking note of conditions such as stream complexity (presence or lack of pools, riffles, meandering thalweg etc.), percent shade on stream, flow and depth variability, bank stability, access to floodplain, wood recruitment, unnatural barriers and condition and quantity of riparian vegetation. Based on the these conditions, a classification of excellent, good, moderate, or poor was assigned. Atmospheric pressure, wind speed and air temperature were measured with a Kestrel handheld weather meter, cloud cover was assessed visually. A site key in addition to the date, time and location (latitude/longitude and UTM) is included.  Not all sites have values for discharge and pebble count due to hazardous conditions. title is Measuring Aquatic Habitat to Support Environmental Modeling and Local Fisheries in Northern Utah. creator is Capito, Lindsay. creator is Fowles, Michael. creator is Null, Sarah E. creator is Kraft, Maggi. author is Capito, Lindsay. creator is Capito, Lindsay. creator is Fowles, Michael. creator is Null, Sarah E. creator is Kraft, Maggi. subject is Dissolved Oxygen. subject is Geomorphic Condition. subject is iUtah. subject is Pebble Count. subject is Total Dissolved Solids. subject is Discharge. subject is Stream Temperature. subject is Weber. organization is Utah State University. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. coverage_type is box. coverage_type is period. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Iutah Data manager. owner is Capito, Lindsay. owner is Fowles, Michael. owner is Kraft, Maggi.

 u'Jupyter notebooks are becoming popular among the geoscience community for there ability to clearly present, disseminate, and describe scientific findings in a transparent and reproducible manner. This also makes them a desirable mechanism for sharing and collaborating scientific data and workflows with colleagues during the research process, especially when addressing large-scale cross-disciplinary geoscience issues. This work extends Jupyter notebooks to operate in a pre-configured cloud environment that is integrated with HydroShare for its data sharing and collaboration functionality, and notebooks are executed on the Resourcing Open Geospatial Education and Research (ROGER) supercomputer hosted in the CyberGIS center.  This design enables researchers to address problems that are often larger in scale than can be done on a typical desktop computer.  Additionally, the integration of these technologies enables researchers to collaborate on notebook workflows that execute in the cloud and are shared through the HydroShare platform. The goals of this work are to establish an open source platform for domain scientists to (1) conduct data intensive and computationally intensive collaborative research, and (2) organize data driven educational material via classroom modules, workshops, or training courses.  This presentation will discuss recent efforts towards achieving these goals, and describe the architectural design of the notebook server in an effort to support collaborative and reproducible science.\r\ntitle is Facilitating Collaborative Science using HydroShare  and Jupyter Notebooks. creator is Castronova, Anthony. creator is Yin, Dandong. creator is Leonard, Lorne. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Tarboton, David. author is Castronova, Anthony. creator is Castronova, Anthony. creator is Yin, Dandong. creator is Leonard, Lorne. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Tarboton, David. subject is RHESSys. subject is Python. subject is JupyterHub. subject is TauDEM. subject is CUAHSI HydroInformatics Conference. subject is NWM. subject is Landlab. organization is CUAHSI. organization is The Pennsylvania State University. organization is University of Washington. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Castronova, Anthony.

It supports the sharing of and collaboration around \u201cresources\u201d which are defined by standardized content types for data formats and models commonly used in hydrology.  With HydroShare you can: Share your data and models with colleagues; Manage who has access to the content that you share; Share, access, visualize and manipulate a broad set of hydrologic data types and models; Use the web services application programming interface (API) to program automated and client access; Publish data and models and obtain a citable digital object identifier (DOI); Aggregate your resources into collections; Discover and access data and models published by others; Use web apps to visualize, analyze and run models on data in HydroShare.  HydroShare supports web apps to act on resources for cloud (server) based visualization and analysis, including large scale geographic and digital elevation model analysis at the CyberGIS center at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and capability to execute hydrology models (e.g. SWAT and RHESSys models) and connect to geoscience modeling communities (e.g. Landlab). A pending proposal for the next phase of HydroShare development would extend the capabilities of HydroShare to enhance support for model hypothesis testing using the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) approach, advance collaboration capability, integrate with 3rd party consumer cloud storage systems and establish an "App Nursery" to enable community coders to develop web apps linked to HydroShare. This presentation will describe the functionality and architecture of HydroShare comprising: (1) resource storage, (2) resource exploration, and (3) actions on resources by web apps. System components are loosely coupled and interact through APIs, which enhances robustness, as components can be upgraded and advanced relatively independently. The full power of this paradigm is the extensibility it supports, in that anybody can develop a web app that interacts with resources stored in HydroShare.  We welcome discussion of the opportunities this enables for interoperability with other cyberinfrastructure tools, to the benefit of the hydrology and hydroinformatics research communities.title is HydroShare Present and Future: Advances in the Hydroshare Platform for Collaborative Data and Model Sharing. creator is Tarboton, David. author is Tarboton, David. creator is Tarboton, David. subject is CUAHSI2017. subject is Presentation. organization is Utah State University. organization is The HydroShare Team. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Tarboton, David.

 u'The introduction of pollutants into storm water runoff can be concerning since it can act as a vector for environmental pollution or even household contamination. This study will assess the microbial contamination of storm water runoff from various sources including a metal roof, a photocell, and dry wells collecting roof and parking lot runoff on the USU campus. The microbes being tested for are total coliforms, E. coli, and enterococcus. ISCO auto samplers and grab samples were used to gather storm water samples. Simulations were ran using off-gassed tap water on the metal roof a photovoltaic cell. The concentrations of the three microbes in the samples were determined using the IDEXX Quanti-tray 2000 system. It was found that samples taken from the dry wells had greater concentrations of total coliform and E. coli than surface samples. It was also found that the metal roof on the pump house had greater concentrations of all three indicator bacteria than the photovoltaic cell atop the roof.title is Concentrations of bacteria  in storm water runoff. creator is Beyer, Chase. creator is Dupont, R Ryan. author is Beyer, Chase. creator is Beyer, Chase. creator is Dupont, R Ryan. subject is FIB. subject is indicator. subject is fecal. subject is storm water. subject is stormwater. subject is runoff. subject is bacteria. organization is iUTAH. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u'Data archival and dissemination is a challenging task for scientists and engineers, and if not done properly, hinders discovery of data applicable to an ongoing project. The next generation of scientists must be well versed in numerous methods of discovering, collecting, and processing water-related data, which is further complicated by the variety in data repositories,  le formats, and encoding standards. CUAHSI (the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science Inc.; https://www.cuahsi.org/) offers free data services and tools to address these issues.

 u'Data archival and dissemination is a challenging task for scientists and engineers, and if not done properly, hinders discovery of data applicable to an ongoing project. The next generation of scientists must be well versed in numerous methods of discovering, collecting, and processing water-related data, which is further complicated by the variety in data repositories,  le formats, and encoding standards. CUAHSI (the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science Inc.; https://www.cuahsi.org/) offers free data services and tools to address these issues. This workshop presents recent software development efforts to support (1) advanced data searching via the HIS Catalog API and (2) cloud-based hydrologic data analysis. The structure of this workshop will be a mixture of short presentations and interactive tutorials aimed to provide an introduction to research-oriented data discovery and analysis.

With HydroShare one can: share one\u2019s data and models with colleagues; manage who has access to the content that is shared; share, access, visualize and manipulate a broad set of hydrologic data types and models; use the web services application programming interface (API) to program automated and client access; publish data and models and obtain a citable digital object identifier (DOI); aggregate your resources into collections; discover and access data and models published by others; and use web apps to visualize, analyze and run models on data in HydroShare. The integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS, see http://irods.org/) is an open-source distributed data management system with worldwide adoption and is being used to manage data content within HydroShare. iRODS supports distributed shared data collections and has been used to enable regional, national, and international research collaborations. Through iRODS ability to federate with other iRODS datagrids, HydroShare is able to federate with and enable its users access to important national data sets such as an extended archive of the NOAA National Water Model. The HydroShare iRODS federation model also enables extended storage models so as to allow large organizations such as University campuses to provision their own storage and set their own quotas within the existing HydroShare framework, thus presenting this federated extended storage in a manner transparent to the end user. Web apps that federate or join with the HydroShare data grid may use iRODS rapid data transfer functionality to access data in HydroShare. Furthermore, iRODS enables HydroShare users to efficiently transfer data and resources into and out of HydroShare that are tens of gigabytes in size, including if these data or resources are in other iRODS-based national cyberinfrastructure such as CyVerse. In this presentation, we will describe these and other capabilities as an extended storage ecosystem for HydroShare.title is An Extended Storage Ecosystem for HydroShare. creator is Idaszak, Ray. author is Idaszak, Ray. creator is Idaszak, Ray. subject is CUAHSI2017. subject is Presentation. subject is iRODS. organization is RENCI, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. organization is The HydroShare Team. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. source is https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/6cb2da4dffa248c09bc4d7d883fdf4a1/#rating-6544. relation is https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/6cb2da4dffa248c09bc4d7d883fdf4a1/#rating-6544. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Idaszak, Ray.

 u'This resource was developed as a HydroShare workshop demonstration for the CUAHSI Hydroinformatics conference, July 25-27, 2017, Tuscaloosa, AL.\r\n\r\nWhen you open this resource with the CUAHSI JupyterHub server (upper right, click on Open With, Select JupyterHub NCSA), you will launch a Welcome Notebook that will connect you to the CyberGIS virtual machine on the ROGER super computer at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagne.   When you execute (Run Step 1 and Step 2 only) in the Jupyter Notebook cells on the Welcome Notebook, you will download related data and two Notebooks designed to explore hydrologic research problem solving using data and model integration in HydroShare .  Skip Step 3 "Welcome"  tutorial steps unless you want to explore how to do work and Save back to HydroShare. \r\n\r\nClick on the hyperlink to ThunderCreek_DataIntegration_Beginner.ipynb.   The beginner notebook is an  Introduction for new HydroShare users who may have limited experience with Python code and Jupyter Notebooks.  The advanced notebook explores how to combine watershed data with hydrology models (e.g. DHSVM) and the Landlab modeling framework (e.g. landsliding). \r\n\r\nThe problem: Researchers need a modeling workflow that is flexible for developing their own code, with easy access to distributed datasets, shared on a common platform for coupling multiple models, usable by science colleagues, with easy publication of data, code, and scientific studies.  \r\n\r\nThe emerging solution: Collaborate with the CUAHSI HydroShare community to use and contribute to water data software and hardware tools, so that you can focus on your science, be efficient with your time and resources, and build on existing research in multiple domains of water science.  \r\n\r\nBeginner Notebook  (time savings ~ 9 months)  \r\nDownload water data from CUAHSI HIS   \r\nDevelop your own utilites (e.g. download hydrometeorology) \r\nSave your results on HydroShare for your colleagues \r\n\r\nAdvanced Notebook  (time savings ~2.5 years)  \r\nRun a preconfigured hydrology model installed on the CUAHSI JupyterHub server \r\nRun a published Landlab landslide model\r\nPublish your results and get a DOI \r\n\r\nThis is a Watershed Dynamics Model developed by the Watershed Dynamics Research Group in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at the University of Washington for the Thunder Creek basin in the Skagit Watershed, WA, USA in collaboration with CUAHSI.\r\n\r\nThe resource was originally derived from a reproducible demonstration of the landslide modeling results from: Strauch, R., Istanbulluoglu, E., Nudurupati, S. S., Bandaragoda, C., Gasparini, N. M., and Tucker, G. E.: A hydro-climatological approach to predicting regional landslide probability using Landlab, Earth Surf. Dynam.

 u'GIS-Based Mapping of Soil Distribution in Thunder Creek Watershed\r\nTraditionally, information about soil distribution has been acquired through intensive fieldwork.  Although ideal, this technique is not feasible in the National Parks and wilderness areas in Washington where hiking trails provide the only access to many hectares of land.  With the increasing capabilities of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing software, it is possible to model soil-landscape relationships via digital topographic and environmental data and satellite imagery as proxies for the soil-forming factors, combined with a reduced amount of fieldwork.  In this study, a quantitative model of soil distribution in the 30,000 hectare Thunder Creek Watershed in North Cascades National Park (NOCA) is being created based on information acquired from digital data and field sampling.title is NOCA NPS Soil Distribution. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. author is Bandaragoda, Christina. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. subject is thunder creek. subject is watershed. subject is soils. organization is University of Washington. availability is public. coverage_type is point. format is image/png. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u'This data set contains stable isotope values of tap water collected in the Salt Lake Valley (SLV) from 2013 to 2016. \r\n\r\nThe proposed goals for the project was to: \r\n1. Characterize tap water isoscapes across SLV  to develop isotope budgets for tap water systems. \r\n2. Use the budgets and infrastructure data to infer the most important contributing regions to different municipal systems and evaporative water loss from these systems. \r\n3. Combine management data, isotope characterization of environmental waters, and tap water isotope data to develop isotopic fingerprints for contrasting water management practice \r\n\r\nData Collection Methods: Collected tap water from different municipal districts across the SLV in a series of bi-annual hydrological surveys. The samples are collected from local businesses, homes and offices in April and September/October every year since 2013.The survey was designed in hydrologically contrasting seasons to capture potential seasonal differences in the tap water isotopes.\r\n\r\nLocation of Data Collection: We have collected data from approximately 140 sites every survey so far. The sites are located within the Salt Lake county, Utah. So far we have collected more than 800 samples. Each site is assigned a unique site ID (for example: SLV-WS-049 which stands for Salt lake valley water site number 049). The metadata includes the complete address and geographic location of the sites. \r\n\r\n\r\nTiming of Data Collection:\r\n             April (04/25/2013) and October 2013 (10/02/2013)\r\n             April (04/29/2014) and September 2014 (09/25/2014)\r\n             April (04/28/2015) and September 2015 (09/28/2015)\r\n             April (04/27/2016) and October 2016 (10/01/2016)\r\n\r\nData Analysis: For each site, samples were obtained by running the tap water for ~15 seconds before filling, capping and sealing (with parafilm) a clean 4 ml glass vial. Samples were analyzed for their isotopic composition within a few weeks of their collection at the Stable Isotope Ratios for Environmental Research (SIRFER), University of Utah, on Picarro L2130-i Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer. All the sample values are reported using the \u03b4 notation, where \u03b4=Rsample/Rstandard -1, R= 2H/1H and 18O/16O. Four injections of each sample were measured and corrected for memory effects, through-run drift, and calibrated to the VSMOW-VSLAP scale, using a suite of three laboratory reference waters (PZ: 16.9\u2030, 1.65\u2030; PT: -45.6\u2030, -7.23\u2030; UT: -123.1\u2030, -16.52\u2030; for \u03b42H and \u03b418O, respectively).\r\n       \r\nWe published the results in Water resources research ( DOI: 10.1002/2016WR019104)\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntitle is Salt Lake Valley tap water isotope ratio dataset. creator is Jameel, Yusuf. author is Jameel, Yusuf. creator is Jameel, Yusuf. subject is Water Resources. subject is Water management. subject is Tap water. subject is Stable Isotopes. availability is public. coverage_type is period. coverage_type is point. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. format is text/csv. format is application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Jameel, Yusuf. owner is Iutah Data manager.

 u'Wastewater treatment plants significantly reduce the microbe levels in water. However, the remaining microbes may regrow in the nutrient-rich wastewater effluent.\r\nTherefore, using this reclaimed effluent as a secondary water source can potentially contaminate crops. For this study, an agricultural field was irrigated using reclaimed wastewater from the Hyrum Wastewater Treatment Plant. The water was tested before and after irrigation to determine the microbial load applied to the crops. Then, daily plant samples were collected to determine both the initial microbial contamination level and the die-off after the irrigation event.  All samples were tested on IDEXX\u2019s Colilert and Enterolert trays. These trays contain large and small wells that each give positive/negative results. The different sized wells act like different dilutions to help quantify bacteria concentrations. Positive wells are counted and an IDEXX table used to convert the well counts into MPN counts for coliforms, E. coli, and Enterococcus, all found in high levels in wastewater influent. Test results demonstrated microbial regrowth in the reclaimed wastewater system. Additionally, the reclaimed water contaminated the irrigated plants and the contamination level was reduced significantly in the first 48 hours after wastewater application.\r\ntitle is Microbial Contamination and Die-Off on Crops Irrigated With Reclaimed Wastewater. creator is Conor Tyson. creator is Dupont, R Ryan. author is Conor Tyson. creator is Conor Tyson. creator is Dupont, R Ryan. subject is Waste water. subject is Irrigation. subject is Contamination. subject is Microbiology. subject is IDEXX. organization is Utah Water Research Laboratory. availability is public. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Conor Tyson. owner is Iutah Data manager.

 u"Forty-two water decision makers in cities in Utah were identified representing elected official positions as well as staff (e.g., public utilities, public works, etc.). Three valleys in the rapidly growing Northern Utah Wasatch Range Metropolitan Area (WRMA) are represented. In smaller cities where staff play multiple roles, those who performed some operations in water management were selected. Those selected for interviews were identified through city websites and, in a few cases, phone calls to city hall. Participants were contacted by email first and followed up telephone as needed. \r\n\r\nAll of the interviews were conducted in-person between November 2015 and July 2016. During this time, city elections complicated contact and identifying key informants. When able, we interviewed the incumbents. Only one potential respondent who had initially agreed to an interview canceled without follow-up, for a response rate of 97.6%. Interviews were audio-recorded and tended to last between 20 and 90 minutes each. Each interview was transcribed with the help of two transcribers and deductively coded for themes by a team of three using NVIVO 11 Pro. The team started with an a priori coding matrix based on the interview guide and allowed for additional themes to emerge through the revision of categories and the coding agenda, reaching inter-coder reliability (<80% kappa coefficient). The database in NVIVO titled CKI_project_TEAM contains 40 transcribed interviews. One interview was not coded due to irrelevance and the pilot interview was not coded. Interview 013 does not exist because the respondent canceled. Overall, coders maintained a range of kappa coefficients with % minimum agreement. The final agreement measurements were calculated on Interview 38 which was coded by all three coders. High dual-coder agreement was also attained on the following interviews: 001, 003, 004, and 011. Coders met weekly to retain alignment in nodes and definitions (qualitative agreement). Coders were instructed to code every respondent sentence to the period (quantitative agreement). If the respondent's answer was short (e.g., Yes/No), the coder coded the interview question along with the answer to retain context. Respondents were asked the following: 1) the one key water issue facing their city today; 2) if their city had an adequate water supply to meet their city\u2019s needs today, and 3) did they think their city had an adequate water supply to meet their city\u2019s needs in the future. title is Community Key Informant Final. creator is Haeffner, Melissa. creator is Flint, Courtney G. creator is Jackson-smith, Douglas. author is Haeffner, Melissa. creator is Haeffner, Melissa. creator is Flint, Courtney G. creator is Jackson-smith, Douglas. contributor is Ennea Fairchild. contributor is Kenley, Natalie Harker. contributor is Barnett, Matt. subject is water. subject is urban. subject is Utah. subject is public utilities. organization is Utah State University - Logan, UT. organization is Utah State University. organization is The Ohio State University. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u'This resource was developed as a HydroShare workshop demonstration for the CUAHSI Hydroinformatics conference, July 25-27, 2017, Tuscaloosa, AL.\r\n\r\nWhen you open this resource with the CUAHSI JupyterHub server (upper right, click on Open With, Select JupyterHub NCSA), you will launch a Welcome Notebook that will connect you to the CyberGIS virtual machine on the ROGER super computer at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagne.   When you execute (Run Step 1 and Step 2 only) in the Jupyter Notebook cells on the Welcome Notebook, you will download related data and two Notebooks designed to explore hydrologic research problem solving using data and model integration in HydroShare .  Skip Step 3 "Welcome"  tutorial steps unless you want to explore how to do work and Save back to HydroShare. \r\n\r\nClick on the hyperlink to ThunderCreek_DataIntegration_Beginner.ipynb.   The beginner notebook is an  Introduction for new HydroShare users who may have limited experience with Python code and Jupyter Notebooks.  The advanced notebook explores how to combine watershed data with hydrology models (e.g. DHSVM) and the Landlab modeling framework (e.g. landsliding). \r\n\r\nThe problem: Researchers need a modeling workflow that is flexible for developing their own code, with easy access to distributed datasets, shared on a common platform for coupling multiple models, usable by science colleagues, with easy publication of data, code, and scientific studies.  \r\n\r\nThe emerging solution: Collaborate with the CUAHSI HydroShare community to use and contribute to water data software and hardware tools, so that you can focus on your science, be efficient with your time and resources, and build on existing research in multiple domains of water science.  \r\n\r\nBeginner Notebook  (time savings ~ 9 months)  \r\nDownload water data from CUAHSI HIS   \r\nDevelop your own utilites (e.g. download hydrometeorology) \r\nSave your results on HydroShare for your colleagues \r\n\r\nAdvanced Notebook  (time savings ~2.5 years)  \r\nRun a preconfigured hydrology model installed on the CUAHSI JupyterHub server \r\nRun a published Landlab landslide model\r\nPublish your results and get a DOI \r\n\r\nThis is a Watershed Dynamics Model developed by the Watershed Dynamics Research Group in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at the University of Washington for the Thunder Creek basin in the Skagit Watershed, WA, USA in collaboration with CUAHSI.\r\n\r\nThe resource was originally derived from a reproducible demonstration of the landslide modeling results from: Strauch, R., Istanbulluoglu, E., Nudurupati, S.

 u'Although controlling the level of contamination everywhere in the surface water network may not be feasible, it is vital to maintain safe water quality levels in specific areas, e.g. recreational waters. The question then is \u201cwhat is the most efficient way to fully/partially control water quality in surface water networks?\u201d.\r\nThis can be posed as a control problem where the goal is to efficiently drive the system to a desired state by manipulating few input variables. Such problems reduce to (1) finding the best control locations in the network to influence the state of the system; and (2) choosing the time-variant inputs at the control locations to achieve the desired state of the system with minimum effort. We demonstrate that the optimal solution to control the level of contamination in the network can be found through application of control theory concepts to transport in  surface water networks.title is Controllability of Surface Water Networks - AGU2016 Presentation. creator is Riasi, M.

 u'This is the poster presented at the Earthcube all hands meeting June 7, 2017.\r\n\r\nHydroShare is an online, collaboration system for sharing hydrologic data, analytical tools, and models.  It supports the sharing of and collaboration around \u201cresources\u201d which are defined by standardized content types for data formats and models commonly used in hydrology.  Currently, with HydroShare you can: share your data and models with colleagues; manage who has access to the content that you share; share, access, visualize, and manipulate a broad set of hydrologic data types and models; publish data and models and obtain a citable digital object identifier (DOI); aggregate your resources into collections; discover and access data and models published by others; use the web services application programming interface (API) to programmatically  access resources; and use integrated web applications to visualize, analyze and run models on data in HydroShare.  Composite resources allow multiple file types from a study to be combined together, providing, as a single resource, an aggregation of all the data elements associated with a model or study. Hydroshare\u2019s composite resource construct can be used to support software that enables transparency and reproducibility, and thereby enhance trust in the research findings. Toward this, as part of the EarthCube GeoTrust project we are investigating how the composite resource construct can be extended to support transparency and reproducibility. The EarthCube GeoTrust project is creating \u201cgeounits\u201d which are self-contained packages of computational experiments that can be guaranteed to repeat or reproduce regardless of deployment issues. Since geounits provide a complete description of all the data elements with an instance (run) of a computational experiment, including input files, parameter files, the model executable, associated libraries, and output files produced, they can be mapped to a specialization of HydroShare\u2019s composite resource type. This has a direct effect of transforming HydroShare into a repository of geounits, and making published and cited experiments not only accessible but also reproducible, thereby enhancing trust in them. Tools that create geounits use HydroShare\u2019s REST API to load them into HydroShare, where they can then be shared with other users and downloaded for reproduction of the computational experiment, or further research with additional or alternate data.  This presentation will describe the functionality and architecture of HydroShare that enables the creation of geounits comprising: (1) resource storage, (2) resource exploration, and (3) actions on resources by web applications. HydroShare\u2019s components are loosely coupled and interact through APIs, which enhances robustness, as components can be upgraded and advanced relatively independently. The full power of this paradigm is the extensibility it supports, in that anybody can develop a web application that interacts with resources stored in HydroShare.  We welcome discussion of the opportunities this enables for interoperability with other EarthCube tools, to the benefit of the geoscience research community.title is HydroShare:  A Platform for Collaborative Data and Model Sharing in Hydrology. creator is Tarboton, David. author is Tarboton, David. creator is Tarboton, David. subject is Earthcube. subject is presentation. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. format is application/pdf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Tarboton, David.

 u'The ability to test hypotheses about hydrology, geomorphology and atmospheric processes is invaluable to research in the era of big data. Although community resources are available, there remain significant educational, logistical and time investment barriers to their use.  Knowledge infrastructure is an emerging intellectual framework to understand how people are creating, sharing and distributing knowledge -- which has been dramatically transformed by Internet technologies.  In addition to the technical and social components in a cyberinfrastructure system, knowledge infrastructure considers educational, institutional, and open source governance components required to advance knowledge. We are designing an infrastructure environment that lowers common barriers to reproducing modeling experiments for earth surface investigation. Landlab is an open-source modeling toolkit for building, coupling, and exploring two-dimensional numerical models.  HydroShare is an online collaborative environment for sharing hydrologic data and models. CyberGIS-Jupyter is an innovative cyberGIS framework for achieving data-intensive, reproducible, and scalable geospatial analytics using the Jupyter Notebook based on ROGER - the first cyberGIS supercomputer, so that models that can be elastically reproduced through cloud computing approaches. Our team of geomorphologists, hydrologists, and computer geoscientists has created a new infrastructure environment that combines these three pieces of software to enable knowledge discovery. Through this novel integration, any user can interactively execute and explore their shared data and model resources.  Landlab on HydroShare with CyberGIS-Jupyter supports the modeling continuum from fully developed modelling applications, prototyping new science tools, hands on research demonstrations for training workshops, and classroom applications.

 u"In-stream barriers, such as dams, culverts and diversions, are important for economic water uses but alter hydrologic processes and aquatic habitat. Removing uneconomical and aging in-stream barriers to improve stream habitat is increasingly used in river restoration. Previous barrier removal projects focused on score-and-rank techniques, ignoring cumulative change and spatial structure of barrier networks. Likewise, most water supply models prioritize either human water uses or aquatic habitat, failing to incorporate both human and environmental water use benefits. In this study, a dual objective optimization model prioritized removal of in-stream barriers impeding aquatic habitat connectivity for trout, using streamflow, temperature, channel gradient, and geomorphic condition as indicators of aquatic habitat suitability. Water scarcity costs are minimized using agricultural and urban economic penalty functions and a budget constraint monetizes costs of removing small barriers like culverts and diversions. The optimization model developed is generalizable, but applied to a case study in Utah\u2019s Weber River basin to prioritize removal of the most environmentally harmful barriers, while maintaining human water uses. The dual objective solution basis was developed to quantify and graphically understand tradeoffs between connected quality-weighted habitat for Bonneville cutthroat trout and economic water uses. Modeled results suggest tradeoffs between economic costs of removing barriers and quality-weighted habitat gains. Removing 251 in-stream barriers increases quality-weighted habitat by about 460 km and costs approximately $58.9 M after which point, the cost effectiveness of removing barriers to connect river habitat slows. This research will help prioritize barrier removals and future restoration project decisions within the Weber basin. The modeling approach expands the current barrier removal optimization methodology by thoroughly including economic and environmental water uses.  title is Optimizing Barrier Removal in Utah's Weber Basin. creator is Kraft, Maggi. creator is Null, Sarah. author is Kraft, Maggi. creator is Kraft, Maggi. creator is Null, Sarah. contributor is Null, Sarah. subject is optimization. subject is habitat suitability. subject is cutthroat trout. organization is Utah State University. availability is private. format is text/plain. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. format is application/zip. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Kraft, Maggi. owner is Null, Sarah.

 u'Introduction:  Stable isotopes of water have extensively been used to understand hydrological cycle in natural environment,  however their application in highly managed urban water systems have been limited. Recent research have shown that water isotopes reflect urban water management practices and have potential application in understanding  urban water supply network dynamics, evaluating effect of climate variability on water resources,  geolocation and water monitoring and regulation.\r\n\r\nJameel and colleagues ( WRR, 2016) attributed the strong and structured spatiotemporal variation in tap water isotope ratios of Salt Lake Valley (SLV) to complex distribution systems, varying water management practices and multiple sources used across the valley. Building on their result, we collaborated with the largest water supply company in SLV, Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District (JVWCD) and expanded our project which now includes predicting the source (or sources) contributing to a given supply area. The different sources supplying JVWCD (such as Provo River system, Wasatch Creeks and groundwater wells) have similar yet distinct isotope ratios, providing an excellent opportunity to test the robustness of water isotopes in monitoring distribution pattern of the sources in the supply system. For this project, we collected more than 100 samples/month (between April 2015-May 2016), from different water sources (creeks, streams and groundwater wells), water treatment plants (WTP), storage reservoirs and delivery locations along the supply lines across the water distribution area , measured their isotopic ratio and developed isotopic mixing models using Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) framework to understand the flow of water in an urban supply system and connect tap water at a specific  location to its respective sources. \r\n\r\nData Collection Methods:   Water samples collected from source, reservoirs, and different locations within the JVWCD service area.\r\n\r\nLocation of Data Collection:   we collect approximately 100 samples per month. From May 2015 to April 2016, for each month, we sampled different sources supplying water to the JVWCD service area and at numerous locations on the JVWCD distribution line (subsequently referred to as supply sites). Source water samples were collected as effluent from the WTPs and from groundwater wells and supply sites samples were collected from monitoring taps positioned on the distribution line. Source and supply sites were sampled 1-3 times per month.\r\n\r\nData Analysis:  For each site, samples were obtained by running the tap water for ~15 seconds before filling, capping and sealing (with parafilm) a clean 4 ml glass vial. Samples were analyzed for their isotopic composition within a few weeks of their collection at the Stable Isotope Ratios for Environmental Research (SIRFER), University of Utah, on Picarro L2130-i Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer. All the sample values are reported using the \u03b4 notation, where \u03b4=Rsample/Rstandard -1, R= 2H/1H and 18O/16O. Four injections of each sample were measured and corrected for memory effects, through-run drift, and calibrated to the VSMOW-VSLAP scale, using a suite of three laboratory reference waters (PZ: 16.9\u2030, 1.65\u2030; PT: -45.6\u2030, -7.23\u2030; UT: -123.1\u2030, -16.52\u2030; for \u03b42H and \u03b418O, respectively). \r\n\r\ntitle is JVWCD service area tap water isotope ratio. creator is Jameel, Yusuf. author is Jameel, Yusuf. creator is Jameel, Yusuf. subject is Water tracking. subject is Tap Water. subject is Stable Isotopes. subject is Salt Lake valley. organization is University of Utah. availability is public. coverage_type is period. coverage_type is point. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Jameel, Yusuf. owner is Iutah Data manager.

 u'This data is a collection of CO2 and O2 data starting in December 2016 and goes through mid-July 2017. The remaining 2017 data will be added in December 2017. We are measuring soil CO2 concentration, oxygen, moisture, and temperature. Vaisala CO2 GMP220-series probes are placed at two depths (5 and 20 cm) to measure CO2 concentration and Acclima SDI-12 Interface sensors to measure soil moisture and temperature, as well as Apogee SO-110 soil oxygen sensors. Besides evaluating soil respiration sensitivity (i.e., CO2 evolved per unit change in moisture or temperature), we are evaluating the legacy effects of natural rainfall and snowfall on the structure of soil microbial communities using target metagenomics of 16s rDNA. This data is part of an ongoing project and in the future, will include soil analysis data and microbial analysis data. Quality control will be done on the data before analysis. Power at the sites can go out temporarily, creating gaps in sensor readings. Blank cells in the data represent times when the power to the site went out, or when a sensor died and had to be replaced.

 u'Sediment cores were collected (GPS coordinates taken) at three transects, one at the north end of Utah Lake and two within a kilometer of the Lake on the Jordan River. The cores were sub-sampled at 5 cm resolution for sediment grain size, C and N stable isotope and C/N ratio, and lead-210 analyses.  All sampling was standardized. Sampling data is one time data (summer field collection). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions show a 4 per mil and a 2 per mil positive shift, respectively, as a depth of 55cm. C/N ratios show large variations (9-18) at depths shallower that 55cm, but are more stable (11-14) with greater depth. These results indicate a shift in organic matter sources to Utah Lake at a depth of 55cm, which likely represents the boundary between pre- and post-pioneer settlement in the valley around 1847. At depths greater than 55cm, the major contribution of soil organic matter was likely terrestrial C3 and autochthonous native C4 plants, whereas at depths shallower than 55cm terrestrial vegetation, manure/sewage-derived matter, and lake algae were the major lake organic matter sources. From this information, we approximate the post-settlement sedimentation rate in the lake to be 3.3mm/yr. Students and leads were responsible for data collection, data analysis, and data interpretation of the project. title is Investigating Anthropogenic Impacts on the Utah Lake-Jordan River Transition Zone Using a Multi-proxy Approach. creator is Walther, Suzanne. creator is Wang, Weihong. author is Walther, Suzanne. creator is Walther, Suzanne. creator is Wang, Weihong. subject is isotopes. subject is Utah Lake. subject is grain size. subject is Jordan River. organization is University of San Diego. organization is Utah Valley University. availability is private. coverage_type is period. coverage_type is point. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. format is application/x-qgis. format is application/sbn. format is application/sbx. format is application/xml. format is application/prj. format is application/dbf. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Walther, Suzanne. owner is Iutah Data manager.

 u'This study focused on the geomorphological, ecological, and sedimentological impacts of the Jordanelle Dam Provo River, Utah. This particular study site provides a unique opportunity because the Jordanelle dam was put in place in 1992 and a large scale restoration project was completed in 2008, allowing for high resolution imagery and observations prior to dam placement and restoration. To monitor these effects, we established cross section study sites along the Provo River, with 5 above the dam and 5 below the dam. At each  cross section, we measured baseline channel morphology characteristics via surveying and sediment size distribution via sediment collection and lab grain size analysis processing. We also inventoried vegetation characteristics along the river to monitor differences upstream and downstream of the dam. This data, combined with analysis of historical imagery and current high resolution imagery, enables us to identify geomorphic changes over time and evaluate the impacts of those changes on the post-engineered river system as it applies to current and future watershed management.   Post-impoundment, we find that channels downstream of the dam have become more stable, allowing for vegetation colonization, as exhibited in land cover changes from bare soil to grass. This results in greater species richness owing to colonization of a more stable riparian zone, ultimately changing habitat conditions. Grain size increases below the dam, which is a known dam impact. This data is particularly important as Utah faces climate change and population growth, both of which stress water availability, and has the potential to inform and improve watershed management practices to result in both a healthy fluvial system and a sustainable water resource.title is Stream impoundment: comprehensive riverine effects on the Provo River, Utah. creator is Walther, Suzanne. creator is Martinez, Adriana. author is Walther, Suzanne. creator is Walther, Suzanne. creator is Martinez, Adriana. subject is dam impacts. subject is ecology. subject is channel morphology. subject is sediment dynamics. organization is University of San Diego. organization is Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville. availability is private. coverage_type is period. coverage_type is point. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Walther, Suzanne. owner is Iutah Data manager.

Quantifying changes in water use and groundwater availability in a megacity using novel integrated systems modeling. Geophysical Research Letters, 44. DOI: 10.1002/2017GL074429\r\n\r\nWe developed a new systems modeling framework to quantify the influence of changes in land use, crop growth, and urbanization on groundwater storage for Beijing, China. This framework was then used to understand and quantify causes of observed decreases in groundwater storage from 1993 to 2006, revealing that the expansion of Beijing\'\u2019s urban areas at the expense of croplands has enhanced recharge while reducing water lost to evapotranspiration, partially ameliorating groundwater declines. Please see Hyndman et al. 2017 for full details.\r\n\r\nThis repository contains assembled model input data not easily acquired through cited sources, model-subcomponent output such as annual land use rasters, and the MODFLOW groundwater model files which integrates these subcomponents.\r\n\r\nGroundwater Model and Data\r\nThe MODFLOW groundwater model files and associated data can be found in the "Groundwater Model Files" folder. This includes well observation data, input recharge data, as well as data stored within the groundwater model such as pumping data and aquifer top and bottom. See the readme.txt within the folder and Hyndman et al. 2017 for additional detail.\r\n\r\nAnnual Land Use Rasters\r\nThe "Annual land use rasters" folder contains annually modeled land use.

 u"We collected water samples from the Logan River, Red Butte Creek, and Provo River in Utah in June 2016 to assess the amount of human, ruminant, and dog fecal contamination in these watersheds. Samples were collected in sterile 1L bottles at sites where the iUTAH NSF EPSCoR program has installed aquatic sensor stations along a mountain-to-urban gradient in each watershed. After collection, we filtered samples through 0.2um PES filters, extracted the sample DNA using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit, and analyzed the samples via qPCR.\r\n\r\nBy identifying the major sources of fecal pollution along urbanization gradients in Utah, we hope to inform efforts to manage fecal pollution in Utah's watersheds. In addition to creating generating raw qPCR values that show the relative contributions of each type (human, ruminant, and dog) to fecal pollution in the rivers sampled, we selected primer sets that we hope will be adopted as standard in future fecal pollution assessment efforts. We also created a standard operating procedure for the creation of qPCR standards, which will allow future researchers to determine total numbers of fecal indicator bacteria present in water samples. \r\n\r\nFunded by the iUTAH NSF EPSCoR program (National Science Foundation, iUTAH-innovative Urban Transitions and Aridregion Hydro-sustainability, NSF Award Number 1208732) and conducted at Brigham Young University. title is Preliminary values and standard operating procedures for determining fecal pollution sources in Utah watersheds. creator is Griffin, Natasha. creator is Lee, Rebecca. author is Griffin, Natasha. creator is Griffin, Natasha. creator is Lee, Rebecca. contributor is iUTAH Data Manager. subject is Microbial source tracking. subject is qPCR. subject is Utah. subject is Provo River. subject is Fecal pollution. subject is Logan River. subject is Red Butte Creek. organization is Brigham Young University. organization is Brigham Young University. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document. format is text/csv. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Iutah Data manager. owner is Griffin, Natasha.

Membrane inlet laser spectroscopy to measure H and O stable isotope compositions of soil and sediment pore water with high sample throughput. Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, 31(1), 75-84.\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nRATIONALE: The fast and accurate measurement of H and O stable isotope compositions (\u03b42H and \u03b418O values) of soil and sediment pore water remains an impediment to scaling-up the application of these isotopes in soil and vadose hydrology. Here we describe a method and its calibration to measuring soil and sediment pore water \u03b42H and \u03b418O values using a water vapor-permeable probe coupled to an isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy analyzer.\r\nMETHODS: We compare the water vapor probe method with a vapor direct equilibration method, and vacuum extraction with liquid water analysis. At a series of four study sites in a managed desert agroecosystem in the eastern Great Basin of North America, we use the water vapor probe to measure soil depth profiles of \u03b42H and \u03b418O values.\r\nRESULTS: We demonstrate the accuracy of the method to be equivalent to direct headspace equilibration and vacuum extraction techniques, with increased ease of use in its application, and with analysis throughput rates greater than 7 h\x011. The soil depth H and O stable isotope profiles show that soil properties such as contrasting soil texture and pedogenic soil horizons control the shape of the isotope profiles, which are reflective of local evaporation conditions within the soils.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this water vapor probe method has potential to yield large numbers of H and O stable isotope analyses of soil and sediment waters within shorter timeframes and with increased ease than with currently existing methods. title is Estimation of soil water evaporation from isotope hydrology methods in an agricultural field. creator is Oerter, Erik. author is Oerter, Erik. creator is Oerter, Erik. subject is soil water. subject is isotope hydrology. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

In situ monitoring of H and O stable isotopes in soil water reveals ecohydrologic dynamics in managed soil systems. Ecohydrology, 10(4).\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThe water cycle in urban and hydrologically-managed settings is subject to perturbations that are dynamic on small spatial and temporal scales, the effects of which may be especially profound in soils. We deploy a membrane inlet-based laser spectroscopy system in conjunction with soil moisture sensors to monitor soil water dynamics and H and O stable isotope ratios (\u03b4 H and \u03b418O values) in a seasonally irrigated urban landscaped garden soil over the course of 9 months between the cessation of irrigation in the autumn and the onset of irrigation through the summer. We find that soil water \u03b42H and \u03b418O values predominately reflect seasonal precipitation and irrigation inputs. A comparison of total soil water by cryogenic extraction and mobile soil water measured by in situ water vapor probes, reveals that initial infiltration events after long periods of soil drying (the autumn season in this case) emplace water into the soil matrix that is not easily replaced by, or mixed with, successive pulses of infiltrating soil water. Tree stem xylem water H and O stable isotope composition did not match that of available water sources. These findings suggest that partitioning of soil water into mobile and immobile \u201cpools\u201d and resulting ecohydrologic separation may occur in engineered and hydrologically-managed soils and not be limited to natural settings. The laser spectroscopy method detailed here has potential to yield insights in a variety of Critical Zone and vadose zone studies, potential that is heightened by the simplicity and portability of the system.title is In situ measurements of soil and vadose zone water isotopes reveal water storage and fluxes in semi-aird ecosystems. creator is Oerter, Erik. author is Oerter, Erik. creator is Oerter, Erik. subject is Soil water. subject is isotope hydrology. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u'A version of MODFLOW, called MODFLOW-USG (for UnStructured Grid), was developed to support a wide variety of structured and unstructured grid types, including nested grids and grids based on prismatic triangles, rectangles, hexagons, and other cell shapes. Flexibility in grid design can be used to focus resolution along rivers and around wells, for example, or to subdiscretize individual layers to better represent hydrostratigraphic units.\r\n\r\nMODFLOW-USG is based on an underlying control volume finite difference (CVFD) formulation in which a cell can be connected to an arbitrary number of adjacent cells. To improve accuracy of the CVFD formulation for irregular grid-cell geometries or nested grids, a generalized Ghost Node Correction (GNC) Package was developed, which uses interpolated heads in the flow calculation between adjacent connected cells.\r\n\r\nMODFLOW-USG includes a Groundwater Flow (GWF) Process, based on the GWF Process in MODFLOW-2005, as well as a new Connected Linear Network (CLN) Process to simulate the effects of multi-node wells, karst conduits, and tile drains, for example. The CLN Process is tightly coupled with the GWF Process in that the equations from both processes are formulated into one matrix equation and solved simultaneously. This robustness results from using an unstructured grid with unstructured matrix storage and solution schemes.\r\n\r\nMODFLOW-USG also contains an optional Newton-Raphson formulation, based on the formulation in MODFLOW-NWT, for improving solution convergence and avoiding problems with the drying and rewetting of cells. Because the existing MODFLOW solvers were developed for structured and symmetric matrices, they were replaced with a new Sparse Matrix Solver (SMS) Package developed specifically for MODFLOW-USG. The SMS Package provides several methods for resolving nonlinearities and multiple symmetric and asymmetric linear solution schemes to solve the matrix arising from the flow equations and the Newton-Raphson formulation, respectively.title is MODFLOW_USG Model. creator is Panday, Sorab. creator is Ibaraki, Motomu. creator is Langevin, Christian D.. creator is Niswonger, Richard G.. creator is Hughes, Joseph D.. author is Panday, Sorab. creator is Panday, Sorab. creator is Ibaraki, Motomu. creator is Langevin, Christian D.. creator is Niswonger, Richard G.. creator is Hughes, Joseph D.. subject is control volume finite difference formulation. subject is MODFLOW. subject is MODFLOW-USG. organization is GIS ENVIRONMENTAL. organization is The OHIO State University. organization is USGS. organization is USGS. organization is USGS. availability is public. format is application/x-msdos-program. format is application/pdf. format is application/zip. format is text/plain. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. relation is https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/mfusg/. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Choi, Youngdon.

The tracer tests were performed at 4 different occasions and all four injections were of slug type. Measurements were taken downstream using two Cyclopes 7 from Turner Design, placed upstream and downstream of the reach of interest. The equipment was calibrated, from voltage to concentration RWT, in the lab, using stream water from the site. From every tracer tests there are four columns of data. Column 1: Time since injection (s). Column 2: RWT concentration (ug/L) at upstream point. Column 3: RWT concentration (ug/L) at downstream point.. extra is Hydraulic Conductivity in Tullstorps Brook 2015: This dataset contains hydraulic conductivity (K) of the streambed along 5700 m of the Tullstorps Brook. Measurements were perfomed using a piezometer every 100 m. The piezometer was pushed into the streambed and filled with water and the time it took for the water to infiltrate into the streambed was documented. The hydraulic conductivity was derived through linear regression of the equation: (h/H0 )=(FK/r^2 )t, where h is the water level in the piezometer, H0 is the initial water level, F is a correction factor of the piezometer and r is the piezometer radius. At every cross section measurements were done at 4 points, 2 located at 3 cm depth (column 6) and 2 located at 7 cm depth (column 7). The reported data is the average of the 2 points at each depth. The measurements from two depth were then fit to the equation K = K0*exp(-ay) where K0 is the hydraulic conductivity at the surface (column 8) and a is the decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth (column 9).. extra is Elevation Profiles in Tullstorps Brook 2015: On the 28th of august 2015 the bottom elevation and stream depth was measured relative an arbitrary datum along 450 m of the Tullstorps Brook, Trelleborg, Sweden. Measurements were made using a leveling instrument from Sprinter with an accuracy of  2 mm. The water depth was measured at the same point as the bottom elevation using a rule. The longitudinal coordinate is the distance from the upstream starting point, following the trajectory of the stream. First column: Longitudinal distance (m). Second column: Stream bottom elevation from arbitrary datum (m). Third column: Water depth (m).. ')

 u'Groundwater-surface water (GW-SW)\r\nflux measurement techniques, such as reach mass-balance, seepage meters,\r\nDarcian flux and temperature sensing can be applied simultaneously to provide\r\nmultiple lines of evidence (e.g., Gonzalez et al. 2015, Schmadel et al. 2014,\r\nKennedy et al. 2009, Gilmore et al. 2016b), but challenges remain for\r\ndirectly linking results from different spatial and temporal scales of\r\nmeasurement. For smaller streams where groundwater discharge is a significant\r\npercentage of stream discharge into the reach (typically \u226510%), the\r\nintegrated groundwater flux from point measurements can be compared to a\r\nlarger-scale (i.e. 10^2-10^3 m reach length) approach to confirm results. But\r\nfor reaches in larger stream (river) systems, the stream-groundwater\r\ndischarge ratio is usually much too large to use reach mass balance as a\r\ndirect point of comparison (Gilmore et al. 2016b, Schmadel et al. 2010, Jain,\r\n2000). A promising approach for linking point measurements and testing\r\ninterpolation techniques in large river systems is fiber-optic distributed\r\ntemperature sensing (FO-DTS) (Briggs et al. 2012a, Briggs et al. 2012b, Tyler\r\net al. 2009). FO-DTS uses a fiber-optic cable to detect groundwater discharge\r\nthrough the streambed along the length of the cable (typically \u22641km). This\r\nmay be an effective way to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d between point measurements\r\nof groundwater discharge in large systems (Krause et al. 2012), when other\r\ntechniques like reach mass balance, are not feasible. The overall goal of\r\nthis research is to develop an optimal approach to link point measurements of\r\ngroundwater-surface water fluxes in large river systems. The specific\r\nobjectives are to: (1) test the combined DTS and point-measurement approach\r\nin a small stream, where interpolated results can be confirmed using a reach\r\nmass-balance approach, and (2) apply the technique in larger river systems to\r\ncharacterize spatial distributions and temporal variability of groundwater\r\nfluxes at existing groundwater-surface water monitoring stations on larger\r\nrivers. This project will improve techniques for multi-scale measurement of\r\ngroundwater-surface water interactions, give critical insight into temporal\r\nand spatial variability of water fluxes in larger river systems, and improve\r\nour understanding of the value of existing groundwater-surface water\r\nmonitoring stations. title is Detecting ground water - surface water interaction in streams with DTS. creator is Gilmore, Troy. author is Gilmore, Troy. creator is Gilmore, Troy. subject is DTS. subject is ground water - surface water interaction. subject is Nebraska. subject is Sand Hills. organization is University of Nebraska. availability is private. coverage_type is period. coverage_type is point. format is image/jpeg. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Kratt, Christopher.

 u'This iPython notebook examples the workflow for obtaining and processing gridded meteorology data files with the Observatory Gridded Hydrometeorology library. \r\n\r\nUsing the Sauk-Suiattle watershed as the watershed of interest, users must first TreatGeoSelf to generate a mappingfile that identifies the gridded data files of interest. The function applies a 0.06-degree buffer region by default to the watershed, identifying 98 datafiles. A series of getClimateData functions then download the files to designated subfolders. Thereafter, the gridclim_dict function compiles and computes monthly, annual, and monthly-yearly average values for the temperature and precipitation values for each data set of interest (e.g., livneh 2013 MET, Salathe 2014 raw WRF). Monthly averages are plotted to represent the trend line across the subset date-ranges, separated by the low-, mid-, and high-range elevation datafiles, and for the variable of interest (e.g., average precipitation and average temperature). Finally, the workflow compresses the downloaded files as tar files, then migrates the TAR and PNG files for future analyses as a new HydroShare generic resource.\r\n\r\nThe workflow also introduced functions that read in SNOTEL and COOP data sets, observation data collected from climate stations in the Sauk Riverbasin. In future works, we intend to extend the comparison of the gridded hydrometeorology data sets with Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) outputs and observation data.title is SaukComponentZero - TreatGeoSelf to gridded data. creator is Phuong, Jimmy. author is Phuong, Jimmy. creator is Phuong, Jimmy. organization is University of Washington. availability is private. format is text/x-python. format is application/ipynb. format is text/plain. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Phuong, Jimmy. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina.

 u'Data exploration using GRACE remotely derived groundwater levels and well point datasets\r\n\r\nThe problem:   If the well is dry, is the problem due to hydrology or humans? Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are three countries with an extensive well dataset. What are the spatial statistics of failures? Are functioning/non-functioning wells scattered randomly, or does failure follow a hydrologic pattern?\r\n\r\nA common challenge in interpreting and validating remote sensing data is in comparing these data to direct observations on the ground. Often remotely sensed data will cover large regions and have different temporal and spatial sampling frequency than point observations derived in the field. This kind of analysis requires geospatial tools to enable resampling, assessment of spatial statistics and extrapolation of point data to broader regions. In Geohackweek 2016, our project team (\'Oh Well\') left code to explore this problem in this HydroShare resource. \r\n\r\nPlease see the attached project presentation slide show for an introduction to the team. \r\n\r\nSource of  the Notebook:\r\n<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/amrhein/freshwaterhack/blob/master/grace_wells.ipynb" rel="nofollow">http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/amrhein/freshwaterhack/blob/master/grace_wells.ipynb</a>\r\n\r\nGoogle Earth Engine Resources:\r\nHere is a script that selects a single CHIRPS precipitation image from the collection:\r\n<a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/2870eedb36d247bc25d95c9cc2c4ac50" rel="nofollow">https://code.earthengine.google.com/2870eedb36d247bc25d95c9cc2c4ac50</a>\r\n\r\nHere is a script to get mean CHIRPS data:\r\n<a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/3a09aaa437f327c392ac7798df1e2c09" rel="nofollow">https://code.earthengine.google.com/3a09aaa437f327c392ac7798df1e2c09</a>title is Oh Well Groundwater Geohackweek Project 2016. creator is Amrhein, Dan. creator is Jenkins, Sara. creator is Tasich, Chris. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. author is Amrhein, Dan. creator is Amrhein, Dan. creator is Jenkins, Sara. creator is Tasich, Chris. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. subject is CHIRPS. subject is GRACE. subject is groundwater. subject is Geohackweek. organization is University of Washington. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. format is application/ipynb. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Bandaragoda, Christina. owner is Amrhein, Dan. owner is Tasich, Chris. owner is Jenkins, Sara.

 u'Utah Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the United States west of the Mississippi River, has received\r\nheavy loading of various contaminants, such as high concentrations of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) wastes\r\nfrom raw sewage, effluent from sewage treatment plants, runoff from surrounding agricultural and farming land,\r\nand metals from mining and industrial activities since European settlement. However, the rate of loading of N, P,\r\nand trace metals to Utah Lake varies both in space and time. Therefore, a good understanding of such spatial and\r\ntemporal variability is critical for developing integrated approaches to managing lake water quality. In this project,\r\nwe will take water and floc layer sediment samples from the American Fork River, Provo River, Hobble Creek,\r\nSpanish Fork River, Jordan River and Utah Lake to investigate the temporal and spatial variations in nutrient (P,\r\nN) load and trace metal (mercury/methylmercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, etc.) concentrations. In addition, water\r\nsamples will be analyzed for H and O stable isotopes to establish a water budget for Utah Lake, and floc layer\r\nsediment samples will be analyzed for C and N stable isotopes to differentiate organic matter sources to Utah\r\nLake. Upon completion of this project, we will be able to quantify spatial and temporal variations in nutrient and\r\nmetal loading to Utah Lake and to examine how this variability affects water quality. Furthermore, we will be\r\nable to trace the origins of organic matter sources to the lake and establish nutrient, metal, and water budget for\r\nUtah Lake. The knowledge from this project can guide actions that are increasingly required to safeguard the\r\nservices provided by Utah Lake ecosystem in a future with increasing pressure on freshwater resources. The water,\r\nnutrient, and trace metal budgets developed in this project will provide important information for determining\r\nwhich inflows are contributing the largest contaminant loads to Utah Lake. Consequently, the data derived from\r\nthis project can help state agencies to address significant questions in water quality, hydrologic, environmental,\r\nand biogeochemical sciences and management related to human-environment interactions.title is Investigating Temporal and Spatial Variations of Nutrient and Trace Metal Loading to Utah Lake. creator is Wang, Weihong. author is Wang, Weihong. creator is Wang, Weihong. subject is Utah Lake. subject is Organic Matter. subject is Trace Metal. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Wang, Weihong.

 u'Researchers across the country and around the world expend tremendous resources to gather and analyze vast stores of data and populate models to better understand the process they are studying. Each of those researchers has limited money, time, computational capacity, data storage, and ability to put that data to productive use.  What if they could combine their efforts to make collaboration easier? What if those collected data sets and processed model outputs could be used collaboratively to help advance knowledge beyond their original purpose?  It is these questions that are motivating the movement towards open data, better data management and collaboration and sharing in the use of data and models.  In short, researchers are relying more on teamwork to tackle the big problems of the day.  This seminar will describe research being done at Utah State University and other collaborating organizations developing a system, called HydroShare, to address these questions in the context of water data and models. HydroShare is advancing hydrologic science by enabling the scientific community to more easily and freely share products resulting from their research, not just the scientific publication summarizing a study, but also the data and models used to create the scientific publication.  This capability is necessary for community model development, execution, and evaluation and to improve reproducibility and community trust in scientific findings through transparency. As a platform for collaboration and running models on advanced computational infrastructure, HydroShare enhances the capability for data intensive research in hydrology and other aligned sciences.  This seminar will provide information for you on the data management resources available to you at Utah State University and how you could take advantage of HydroShare in your own work.title is USU Seminar 9/13/17, "Managing and Sharing Research Data Using HydroShare". creator is Tarboton, David. author is Tarboton, David. creator is Tarboton, David. subject is HydroShare Presentation. subject is Seminar. subject is USU91317. organization is Utah State University. organization is The HydroShare Team. availability is public. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. format is application/x-netcdf. format is application/zip. format is image/tiff. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Tarboton, David.

 u'We surveyed more than 2,800 individual trees over an approximately 10 hectare area May 2-5, 2016 at the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory Sagehorn site in Mendocino County, California, USA. Trees species, size (height for juvenile and diameter for mature individuals), canopy position (for mature individuals), and location (meter-scale resolution GPS) were recorded. The survey area is a small portion of a 5,000 acre private cattle ranch that experienced a large fire in 1950 and some logging of Douglas fir in the first half of the twentieth century. The hilly landscape is part of the Central Belt Melange of the Franciscan Formation complex, and surveyed areas were underlain by sheared clay-rich melange matrix (dominant vegetation: annual herbaceous groundcover and Quercus garryana (Oregon White Oak)), as well as poorly sorted, immature sandstone blocks (greywacke; dominant vegetation: Arctostaphylos spp (Manzanita - not surveyed), Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas Fir) and Arbutus menziesii (Pacific Madrone)). Trees with diameters at breast height (1.4 m; DBH) greater than 5 cm (n = 313) were tagged for future surveys.title is Exploratory Tree Survey (2016 - Eel River Critical Zone Observatory - Sagehorn - Central Belt Melange, Franciscan Complex, Northern California Coast Ranges, USA). creator is Hahm, W.

 u'Gensburg Markham Prairie comprises over 100 acres of well-preserved tallgrass prairie and wetland south of Chicago and is one of the Indian Boundary Prairies in Illinois. A U.S. National Natural Landmark, this site is valuable as a sentinel ecosystem for changing regional climate and a reference ecosystem for restoration and management of urban prairie nature preserves. In June of 2016, 10 piezometers containing water level sensors (InSitu LevelTroll 400 pressure transducers) were installed throughout the prairie, in addition to 8 of the same sensors deployed in ditches and surface channels in and around the prairie. The installation coincided with soil sampling and manual-visual characterization at each well location. Each sensor collects a water level measurement every 30 minutes. This installation and sampling campaign is a part of larger effort to assess surface water and groundwater dynamics in urban environments. Additional sensors, including soil moisture and electrical conductivity probes and a rain gauge, provide supplementary data for this project. This resource includes one year of data, from the installation of the sensors to the same date the following summer, capturing the effects of an unusually warm winter in the Chicago metro with very little snow and no extreme temperatures.sample_medium is Liquid aqueous. sample_medium is Air. title is Water Level Measurements; Gensburg Markham Prairie; 2016-2017. creator is Hernandez, Liliana Maria. creator is Rivera, Vivien. creator is Phillips, Colin B. creator is Miller, William M.. creator is Packman, Aaron I.. author is Hernandez, Liliana Maria. creator is Hernandez, Liliana Maria. creator is Rivera, Vivien. creator is Phillips, Colin B. creator is Miller, William M.. creator is Packman, Aaron I.. contributor is Gnaedinger, Karl J.. subject is nature preserve. subject is water level. subject is prairie. subject is wetland. subject is groundwater. organization is Northwestern University. organization is Northwestern University. organization is Northwestern University. organization is Northwestern University. availability is discoverable. coverage_type is period. coverage_type is box. format is text/csv. format is application/sqlite. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Time Series. owner is Rivera, Vivien. owner is Hernandez, Liliana. variable is Water level. variable is Quality Control Flag. variable is Temperature. variable is Pressure, absolute. variable_type is Hydrology. variable_type is Quality Control Flag. variable_type is Hydrology. variable_type is Hydrology. variable_speciation is Not Applicable. variable_speciation is Not Applicable. variable_speciation is Not Applicable. variable_speciation is Not Applicable. site is Water Level Well 4. site is Water Level Surface 5. site is Water Level Surface 8. site is Water Level Well 5. site is Water Level Surface 2. site is Water Level Well 9. site is Water Level Well 6. site is Water Level Surface 3. site is Water Level Surface 6. site is Water Level Well 7. site is Water Level Well 8. site is Water Level Well 10. site is Water Level Surface 4. site is Water Level Well 1. site is Water Level Surface 7. site is Water Level Well 2. site is Water Level Surface 1. site is Water Level Well 3. method is InSitu BaroTroll sensor located at ground surface in same well as WLW8 sensor, measuring atmospheric pressure and temperature at ground level. method is Pressure measured at sensor tip in piezometer, approximately 1 meter below ground surface, and used to calculate water level elevation with correction using InSitu BaroTroll measurements of surface atmospheric pressure and onboard temperature sensors. method is Pressure measured at sensor tip in ditch, with sensor suspended from approximately 1.5 meter cable and exposed to the air, and used to calculate water level elevation with correction using InSitu BaroTroll measurements of surface atmospheric pressure and onboard temperature sensors. method is The first pass over the data with a Python script flags questionable measurements based on the elevation of the sensor and water level to indicate when the sensor is most likely dry and not measuring water pressure.

 u'This resource contains the results of a nutrient uptake incubation experiment conducted at a mountain and urban site on the Logan River in northern Utah.  The experiments were performed with biofilms grown for 14-15 days on nutrient diffusing substrates (NDS), 1-oz plastic cups filled with agar and capped with a fritted glass disc.  We performed the nutrient uptake experiment by incubating biofilm-colonized discs in clear plastic jars filled with stream water spiked with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) at a series of concentrations.  The CSV file "nutrient uptake treatments" lists the treatments used in the nutrient uptake experiment at each site.   Biofilms were incubated in situ for 2 hours at midday. Samples for dissolved nutrient analysis were collected from the nutrient treatment solutions used to fill the jars and from each jar at the end of the incubation.  The dissolved oxygen concentration in each jar was measured at the start and end of the incubation.  We calculated nutrient uptake rates as the rate of loss in water nutrients and net primary production as the change in dissolved oxygen concentration.  We measured biofilm biomass as chlorophyll a.  The CSV file \u201cnutrient uptake results\u201d contains summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, count) of nutrient uptake rates, net primary production rates, and chlorophyll a concentrations in nutrient uptake treatments at each site.  The Word document \u201cnutrient uptake analytical methods\u201d contains the analytical methods used to measure nutrient concentrations.\r\n\r\nWe also examined biofilm nutrient limitation at each site using NDS.  We constructed nutrient limitation NDS by filling 1-oz plastic cups with agar amended with either no nutrients (control), 0.5 M NH4-N (N), 0.5 M PO4-P (P), or 0.5 M NH4-N + 0.5 M PO4-P (N+P). NDS were then capped with a fritted glass disc and placed in the stream at each site during the same period that NDS for the nutrient uptake experiment were deployed.  Biofilm biomass was measured as chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass.  The CSV file \u201cnutrient limitation results\u201d contains summary statistics of chlorophyll a concentration and ash-free dry mass in each nutrient treatment at each site.

 u'Although usage of the inverse solution of the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation for estimating streambed fluid fluxes, bed elevation changes, or bed thermal diffusivity have historically assumed the need for sinusoidal or at least nominally sinusoidal surface boundary temperature fluctuations, it is technically not a requirement.  It has similarly been assumed that gradients in temperature in the bed would cause errors in parameter estimates.  A published mathematical derivation (Luce et al., 2017) demonstrates that this is not true, but laboratory experiments and numerical modeling were done to support the illustration of the consequences of the derivation.  These data are supplied here.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nLuce, C. H., Tonina, D., Applebee, R., & DeWeese, T. (2017). Was that assumption necessary?

 u'This resource contains the results of a diphenhydramine dose-response experiment conducted on stream biofilms at a site on the Logan River in northern Utah.  We grew stream biofilms on inorganic (fritted glass disc) and organic (cellulose sponge) substrates in the river for 20 days.  The biofilm-colonized substrates were then placed as caps on contaminant exposure substrates (CES), 1-oz plastic cups filled with agar amended with diphenhydramine at a series of concentrations (control, 0.5 mM, 0.75 mM, 1.25m M, 2.5 mM, 15 mM).  CES were then deployed in the river for 20 days.\r\nAt the end of the CES deployment, the biofilm-colonized substrates were used to perform a series of in-stream incubations.  We measured respiration and productivity using a modified light-dark bottle incubation method and nitrogen fixation rates using an acetylene reduction assay. We measured biofilm biomass (chlorophyll a, ash-free dry mass) and calculated Autotrophic Index values (calculated as chlorophyll a concentration divided by ash-free dry mass). The CSV file \u201cdiphenhydramine biofilm response\u201d contains summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, count) of respiration rates, gross primary production rates, nitrogen fixation rates, chlorophyll a concentrations, ash-free dry mass, and Autotrophic Index values of biofilms on each diphenhydramine treatment and substrate type.  The Word document \u201cdiphenhydramine analytical methods\u201d describes the analytical methods used to measure chlorophyll and ash-free dry mass.\r\n\r\nWe characterized light availability and nutrient concentrations at the study site.  Hemispherical photos taken of the overlying canopy and time series solar radiation data collected as part of the NSF-funded iUTAH project (Award number 1208732) were analyzed with Gap Light Analyzer software (Frazer et al. 1999).  We estimated percent canopy openness, incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmitted through the canopy, and solar shortwave radiation transmitted through the canopy.  Water column samples collected at each site were analyzed for total and dissolved nutrients.  The CSV file \u201cdiphenhydramine site characteristics\u201d contains percent canopy openness, transmitted PAR, transmitted solar shortwave radiation, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonium, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus, dissolved total iron, and dissolved ferrous iron concentrations.

 u'Landlab is a python-based modeling environment for building numerical models of earth surface processes (https://landlab.github.io/#/). This day-long short course will introduce Landlab and provide hands-on experience to participants with the aim that they will be able to use Landlab in teaching and research upon completing the course. First, we will use Landlab as a watershed analysis tool for hydrologic and geomorphic fluxes. Second, existing coupled models will be introduced and explored, including models for whole landscape evolution, ecohydrology, sediment transport, landslide risk, and flood routing. Participants will run Landlab on their laptops or on CUAHSI\u2019s HydroShare (www.hydroshare.org) using a web browser.\r\n\r\nThis collection holds tutorials developed by instructors of the short course "Landlab Earth Surface Modeling Toolkit: Building and Applying Models of Coupled Earth Surface Processes" held as part of the Geological Society of America annual meeting in Seattle, WA.

 u'As with terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic systems within the Intermountain West are facing a multitude of spatially heterogeneous threats, many of which are linked with projected changes in climate. However, aquatic systems are not predicted to be impacted by changing climate conditions \u2013 namely increases in temperature \u2013 in the same manner nor the same spatial distribution. This necessitates the development of aquatic-specific strategies for quantifying climatic exposure between and within watersheds. Using projected changes in mean annual temperature as localized proxies of climate impact, we assessed how those individual impacts accumulate along with the flow of water. Our results of cumulative climate exposure demonstrated patterns of exposure that are distinct from broad patterns in temperature change itself. We believe that these maps of cumulative climate exposure can be used to inform the management of areas of variable size, including watersheds and major hydrologic basins, in a manner that accounts for the potential vulnerability of these systems to climate changes. We end by emphasizing that decisions to manage based on aquatic system vulnerability would be better informed by taking a more holistic approach that accounts for multiple environmental stressors. title is Projected Aquatic Climate Exposure in Intermountain West Basins. creator is Haight, Jeffrey. author is Haight, Jeffrey. creator is Haight, Jeffrey. subject is climate exposure. subject is flow accumulation. availability is private. format is application/xml. format is application/img. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Haight, Jeffrey.

 u'This resource is a subset of the resource below and provides a demonstration of running a landslide model using Landlab for Thunder Creek watershed within North Cascades National Park Complex (NOCA).  It allows the adjustment of model input to explore effects on landslide probability.\r\n\r\nBandaragoda, C., A. M. Castronova, J. Phuong, E. Istanbulluoglu, S. S. Nudurupati, R. Strauch, N. Gasparini, E. Hutton, G. Tucker, D. Hobley, K. Barnhart, J. Adams, D. Tarboton, S. Wang, D. Yin (2017). Lowering the barriers to computational modeling of Earth\u2019s surface: coupling Jupyter Notebooks with Landlab, HydroShare, and CyberGIS for research and education, HydroShare, http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/70b977e22af544f8a7e5a803935c329c.\r\n\r\nWhen you open this resource with the CUAHSI JupyterHub server (upper right, click on Open With, Select JupyterHub NCSA), you will launch a Welcome Notebook that will connect you to the CyberGIS virtual machine on the ROGER super computer at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagne. When you execute (Run Step 1 and Step 2 only) in the Jupyter Notebook cells on the Welcome Notebook, you will download related data and Notebooks designed to explore hydrologic research problem solving using data and model integration in HydroShare . Skip Step 3 "Welcome" tutorial steps unless you want to explore how to do work and Save back to HydroShare.\r\n\r\nThe problem: Researchers need a modeling workflow that is flexible for developing their own code, with easy access to distributed datasets, shared on a common platform for coupling multiple models, usable by science colleagues, with easy publication of data, code, and scientific studies.\r\n\r\nThe emerging solution: Collaborate with the CUAHSI HydroShare community to use and contribute to water data software and hardware tools, so that you can focus on your science, be efficient with your time and resources, and build on existing research in multiple domains of water science.\r\n\r\nThis is a Watershed Dynamics Model developed by the Watershed Dynamics Research Group in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at the University of Washington for the Thunder Creek basin in the Skagit Watershed, WA, USA in collaboration with CUAHSI.\r\n\r\nThe landslide model was originally derived from a reproducible demonstration of the landslide modeling results from: Strauch, R., Istanbulluoglu, E., Nudurupati, S.

 u'Landlab is a python-based modeling environment for building numerical models of earth surface processes (https://landlab.github.io/#/). This day-long short course will introduce Landlab and provide hands-on experience to participants with the aim that they will be able to use Landlab in teaching and research upon completing the course. First, we will use Landlab as a watershed analysis tool for hydrologic and geomorphic fluxes. Second, existing coupled models will be introduced and explored, including models for whole landscape evolution, ecohydrology, sediment transport, landslide risk, and flood routing. Participants will run Landlab on their laptops or on CUAHSI\u2019s HydroShare (www.hydroshare.org) using a web browser.\r\n\r\nThis collection holds tutorials developed by instructors of the short course "Landlab Earth Surface Modeling Toolkit: Building and Applying Models of Coupled Earth Surface Processes" held as part of the Geological Society of America annual meeting in Seattle, WA.

 u'This tutorial demonstrates implementation of the Cellular Automaton Tree-GRass-Shrub Simulator (CATGRaSS) [Zhou et al., 2013] on a flat domain. This model is built using components from the Landlab component library. CATGRaSS is spatially explicit model of plant coexistence. It simulates local ecohydrologic dynamics (soil moisture, transpiration, biomass) and spatial evolution of tree, grass, and shrub Plant Functional Types (PFT) driven by rainfall and solar radiation. \r\n\r\nEach cell in the model grid can hold a single PFT or remain empty. Tree and shrub plants disperse seeds to their neighbors. Grass seeds are assumed to be available at each cell. Establishment of plants in empty cells is determined probabilistically based on water stress of each PFT. Plants with lower water stress have higher probability of establishment. Plant mortality is simulated probabilistically as a result of aging and drought stress. Fires and grazing will be added to this model soon.  \r\n\r\nThis model (driver) contains:\r\n  - A local vegetation dynamics model that simulates storm and inter-storm water balance and ecohydrologic fluxes (ET, runoff), and plant biomass dynamics by coupling the following components:\r\n        - PrecipitationDistribution\r\n        - Radiation\r\n        - PotentialEvapotranspiration\r\n        - SoilMoisture\r\n        - Vegetation\r\n\r\n  - A spatially explicit probabilistic cellular automaton component that simulates plant competition by tracking establishment and mortality of plants based on soil moisture stress:\r\n        - VegCA\r\n    \r\nTo run this Jupyter notebook, please make sure that the following files are in the same folder:\r\n        - cellular_automaton_vegetation_flat_domain.ipynb (this notebook)\r\n        - Inputs_Vegetation_CA.txt (Input parameters for the model)\r\n        - Ecohyd_functions_flat.py (Utility functions)\r\n\r\n[Ref: Zhou, X, E.

 u'This model simulates runoff for an upland subwatershed in northern New Mexico using a system dynamics platform. The structure for the upland hydrology model was strongly guided by input parsimony while capturing the primary processes of precipitation partitioning, evapotranspiration, baseflow, and saturation excess runoff that influence streamflow at the outlet. The water available in the stream is simulated using a lumped approach that characterizes the upland subwatershed into individual hydrologic response units (HRUs); the HRU method provides sufficient discretization of watershed properties while maximizing computational efficiency. Monthly precipitation and temperature data derived from the Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s datasets, which have a resolution of 1/8th degree, for the upland subwatershed of the Rio Hondo were used as inputs into the model. Note: In addition to simulating streamflow under climate change conditions (i.e., increased temperatures and variable precipitation), the model also has an exploratory module for simulating impacts of wildfires on streamflows. title is Watershed Model in Powersim. creator is Gunda, Thushara. author is Gunda, Thushara. creator is Gunda, Thushara. contributor is Tidwell, Vincent. subject is streamflow. subject is system dynamics. subject is watershed modeling. availability is public. coverage_type is period. coverage_type is box. format is application/sip. format is application/pdf. format is application/vnd.ms-excel. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Gunda, Thushara.

 u'The Diamond Fork River watershed has undergone extreme hydrologic alteration due to irrigation flows being routed through the system since the early 1900s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s infrastructure was completed to transport the irrigation flows but the river was not restored to its natural flow regime. Instead, minimum instream flows were prescribed in the hopes to enhance the fishery and create more habitat. Since 2004, the channel has undergone significant change and the current flow regime is being inspected with regards to its effectiveness of creating a better ecosystem. To best understand the impacts of the current flow regime, understanding the natural flow regime, and the degree to which it is altered is the first step to fully capturing the effect of prescribed minimum instream flows. This paper briefly outlines progress made with regards to this project of understanding the natural flow regime, and future work that needs to be done to understand the degree of alteration.title is Hydrologic Regime Classification of the Diamond Fork River. creator is Stout, Jacob. author is Stout, Jacob. creator is Stout, Jacob. subject is PHYSHYD2017. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. format is application/pdf. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Stout, Jacob.

 u'Steady State and Transient models of Juab Valley converted to MODFLOW 2000 models.\r\n<a href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70179114" rel="nofollow">https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70179114</a>\r\n\r\nPlans to import water to Juab Valley, Utah, primarily for irrigation, are part of the Central Utah Project. A better understanding of the hydrology of the valley is needed to help manage the water resources and to develop conjunctive-use plans.\r\n\r\nThe saturated unconsolidated basin-fill deposits form the ground-water system in Juab Valley. Recharge is by seepage from streams, unconsumed irrigation water, and distribution systems; infiltration of precipitation; and subsurface inflow from consolidated rocks that surround the valley. Discharge is by wells, springs, seeps, evapotranspiration, and subsurface outflow to consolidated rocks. Ground-water pumpage is used to supplement surface water for irrigation in most of the valley and has altered the direction of groundwater flow from that of pre-ground-water development time in areas near and in Nephi and Levan.\r\n\r\nGreater-than-average precipitation during 1980-87 corresponds with a rise in water levels measured in most wells in the valley and the highest water level measured in some wells. Less-than average precipitation during 1988-91 corresponds with a decline in water levels measured during 1988-93 in most wells. Geochemical analyses indicate that the sources of dissolved ions in water sampled from the southern part of the valley are the Arapien Shale, evaporite deposits that occur in the unconsolidated basin-fill deposits, and possibly residual sea water that has undergone evaporation in unconsolidated basin-fill deposits in selected areas. Water discharging from a spring at Burriston Ponds is a mixture of about 70 percent ground water from a hypothesized flow path that extends downgradient from where Salt Creek enters Juab Valley and 30 percent from a hypothesized flow path from the base of the southern Wasatch Range.\r\n\r\nThe ground-water system of Juab Valley was simulated by using the U.S. Geological Survey modular, three-dimensional, finite-difference, ground-water flow model. The numerical model was calibrated to simulate the steady-state conditions of 1949, multi-year transient-state conditions during 1949-92, and seasonal transient-state conditions during 1992-94. Calibration parameters were adjusted until model-computed water levels reasonably matched measured water levels. Parameters important to the calibration process include horizontal hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, and the spatial distribution and amount of recharge from subsurface inflow and seepage from ephemeral streams to the east side of Juab Valley.title is Updated Steady State USGS  MODFLOW Juab Valley UT. creator is Thiros, Susan A.. author is Thiros, Susan A.. creator is Thiros, Susan A.. contributor is Inkenbrandt, Paul C.. subject is MODFLOW. subject is Groundwater. subject is Juab. organization is U.S. Geological Survey. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u"We created a shapefile of Utah's Cache Valley street water conveyance system using ArcGIS. This included gutters, canals, and discontinued canals that transport secondary water to customers. This data collection and research supports coupled human-natural systems research because it connects human and environmental water systems. The purpose of our data collection and mapping is to support future analysis of street gutters and canals as unique secondary water delivery systems. We georeferenced  the network of street water conveyance in summer 2016 that delivers secondary water. We drove, cycled, and walked Logan streets and marked those with observed water conveyance through gutters and canals on a printed map that was then transferred into an ArcGIS shapefile. To accurately determine which street gutters are part of the irrigation water delivery system, we contacted Cache County irrigation companies to receive guidance and feedback. title is Identifying street gutters used for secondary water delivery in urbanized areas of Cache Valley, UT. creator is Null, Sarah E.. creator is Hackett, Andrew. creator is Bottelberghe, Heather. author is Null, Sarah E.. creator is Null, Sarah E.. creator is Hackett, Andrew. creator is Bottelberghe, Heather. contributor is Kraft, Maggi. subject is water conveyance. subject is street. subject is secondary water. organization is Utah State University. organization is Weber State University. organization is Salt Lake Community College. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u'iUTAH researchers have developed and deployed an ecohydrologic observatory to study water in \u2018Gradients Along Mountain to Urban Transitions\u2019 (GAMUT). The GAMUT Network measures aspects of climate, hydrology, and water quality along a mountain-to-urban gradient in three watersheds that share common water sources (winter-derived precipitation) but differ in the human and biophysical nature of land-use transitions. Designing GAMUT was a 12-month process involving faculty and technicians from across Utah\u2019s research-intensive institutions: Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, and Utah State University.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains raw data for all of the air temperature in degrees Celsius measured for the iUTAH GAMUT Network climate site near Beaver Divide.  \r\n\n\n[Modified in JupyterHub on 2017-10-31 19:57:01.896526]\nThis daily average air temperature for the Beaver Divide gauging station that is maintained by iUtah researchers.title is Daily Aggregate Temperature for Beaver Divide. creator is Taher, Ibrahim. author is Taher, Ibrahim. creator is Taher, Ibrahim. subject is Temperatire. subject is Air Temperature. subject is iUtah. subject is Beaver Divide. subject is Time Series. organization is CUAHSI. availability is private. format is text/csv. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Taher, Ibrahim.

 u'The purpose of this research effort is to improve understanding of two key drivers of water use in irrigated landscapes: 1) irrigation technology adoption and 2) irrigation district hierarchies.  The methodology used to address the first driver focuses on integrating economic models of optimal investment with hydrologic models of annual streamflow.  Specifically, this approach quantifies how streamflow trends and streamflow variability influence the adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies in three watershed in Cache Valley.  This improved understanding of the influence of streamflow trends and variability can be used to predict how one specific form of climate adaptation (uptake of water-saving irrigation technologies) will evolve in response to climate trends and variability.  The methodology used to address the second driver is an agent-based model of the behaviors of canal district managers and owners.  This methodology allows us to specify both economic and non-economic behaviors employed by three agent types (canal manager, residential water users, agricultural water users) in a specific canal in Cache Valley.  The model accounts for realistic hydrologic aspects of the canal, the hierarchical relationship between canal managers and water users, as well as the variety of water use objectives held by owners of the canal company.  This research provides an initial glimpse of the relative importance of institutions, social norms, and economics in water use decisions.  These research efforts help solidify the links between RFA2 and RFA3.        title is Economics of water conservation in irrigated landscapes. creator is Sims, Charles. creator is Odame, Augustina. author is Sims, Charles. creator is Sims, Charles. creator is Odame, Augustina. subject is economics. organization is University of Tennessee. organization is Utah State University. availability is public. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Generic. owner is Sims, Charles. owner is Iutah Data manager.

 u'These data are from the following publication:\r\nOerter, E. J., & Bowen, G. (2017). In situ monitoring of H and O stable isotopes in soil water reveals ecohydrologic dynamics in managed soil systems. Ecohydrology, 10(4).\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThe water cycle in urban and hydrologically-managed settings is subject to perturbations that are dynamic on small spatial and temporal scales, the effects of which may be especially profound in soils. We deploy a membrane inlet-based laser spectroscopy system in conjunction with soil moisture sensors to monitor soil water dynamics and H and O stable isotope ratios (\u03b4 H and \u03b418O values) in a seasonally irrigated urban landscaped garden soil over the course of 9 months between the cessation of irrigation in the autumn and the onset of irrigation through the summer. We find that soil water \u03b42H and \u03b418O values predominately reflect seasonal precipitation and irrigation inputs. A comparison of total soil water by cryogenic extraction and mobile soil water measured by in situ water vapor probes, reveals that initial infiltration events after long periods of soil drying (the autumn season in this case) emplace water into the soil matrix that is not easily replaced by, or mixed with, successive pulses of infiltrating soil water. Tree stem xylem water H and O stable isotope composition did not match that of available water sources. These findings suggest that partitioning of soil water into mobile and immobile \u201cpools\u201d and resulting ecohydrologic separation may occur in engineered and hydrologically-managed soils and not be limited to natural settings. The laser spectroscopy method detailed here has potential to yield insights in a variety of Critical Zone and vadose zone studies, potential that is heightened by the simplicity and portability of the system.title is In situ measurements of soil and vadose zone water isotopes reveal water storage and fluxes in semi-aird ecosystems. creator is Oerter, Erik. author is Oerter, Erik. creator is Oerter, Erik. subject is Soil water. subject is isotope hydrology. publisher is Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

 u'This NOCA landslide data repository host the driver code and data files needed to run Landlab\'s LandslideProbability component, which models annual shallow landslide probability  in a steep mountainous region in northern Washington, U.S.A. The model application covers North Cascade National Park Complex (NOCA), using 30-m grid resolution over 2,700 km2.  The model use the classic infinite slope, limited equilibrium model driven by contemporary climatology from  the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model.  Readily available topographic, geophysical, and land cover data are provided to calculate the factor-of-safety stability index in a Monte Carlo simulation, which explicitly accounts for parameter uncertainty.\r\n\r\nData used for this analysis are spatial data on landscape characteristics for NOCA. They include soil, geology, vegetation, topography, and landform data that can be used for quantitative landslides hazard assessment. Elevation was acquired from National Elevation Dataset (NED) at 30 m grid scale; other datasets are matched to scale and location. Slope was derived from the elevation file as "tan theta". Specific contributing area represents the \'upstream\' area draining to each cell divided by the cell\'s width (so minimum value is 30 m). Landform data was developed by Jon Riedel of National Park Service. Landslides were extracted from these data identified as "mass wasting" events. Land use and land cover (LULC) data were acquired from USGS National land Cover Data (NLCD) based on 2011 Landsat satellite data and grouped into eight general categories.  Cohesion represent total cohesion, which is equivalent to root cohesion in this application; soils are assumed to be primarily cohesionless, lacking \u201ctrue cohesion\u201d because of their low clay content in this mountain terrain. Root cohesion is based on the LULC referenced to a look-up table within this resource: (https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/a771ba9bbae24ed8b4673c945fc321a3/). Soil depth comes from Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) maintained by NRCS processed as soil survey depth-to-restricted layer (weighted-average aggregation) within each soil map unit. An alternative modeled soil depth (SD) described in the accompany paper is also provided, but revisions in the driver notebook would be required to reference this file to see adjusted results.  Transmissivity was derived from the soil survey saturated hydraulic conductivity (depth averaged) multiplied by depth-to-restricted layer for each soil map unit; another T file based on the model soil depth is also provided.  However, the model can be run using hydraulic conductivity using data file provided to calculate T. All soils within this watershed are sandy loam or loamy sand; therefore, soil surface texture was used as an indicator of internal angle of friction (phi). A header file is provided to understand the spatial details of the ASCII files and to facilitate capability with GIS. Spatial reference for raster mapping is NAD_1983, Albers conical equal area projection.\r\n\r\nThe model run archived in this resource runs with Landlab version 1.1.0 .  The component code (landslide_probability9Jun17.py) is provided as an archive to run a notebook that replicates results in Strauch et al., (in review) .  As Landlab is developed with newer versions, the notebook and/or provided component code may need updating to run properly.  To run the notebook to replicate results, use the resource "Regional Landslide Hazard Using Landlab - NOCA Observatory", HydroShare resource:  https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/07a4ed3b9a984a2fa98901dcb6751954/title is Regional landslide hazard using Landlab - NOCA Data. creator is Strauch, Ronda. creator is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. creator is Sai Siddhartha Nudurupati. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. author is Strauch, Ronda. creator is Strauch, Ronda. creator is Istanbulluoglu, Erkan. creator is Sai Siddhartha Nudurupati. creator is Bandaragoda, Christina. contributor is Tucker, Greg. contributor is Gasparini, Nicole. contributor is Rochefort, Regina. contributor is Riedel, Jon. subject is VIC. subject is Landlab. subject is hydrology. subject is North Cascades. subject is National Park. subject is landslide. organization is University of Washington. organization is University of Washington. organization is University of Washington - Seattle. organization is University of Washington. availability is private. coverage_type is box. format is text/x-pascal. format is text/plain. format is text/x-python. format is application/ipynb. format is application/prj. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. source is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/0f4efd1cedb64a5a9fa90cf1f248e22f. source is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/a5b52c0e1493401a815f4e77b09d352b. resource_type is Generic. owner is Cakir, Recep. owner is Strauch, Ronda.

 u'Researchers across the country and around the world expend tremendous resources to gather and analyze vast stores of data and populate models to better understand the process they are studying. Each of those researchers has limited money, time, computational capacity, data storage, and ability to put that data to productive use.  What if they could combine their efforts to make collaboration easier? What if those collected data sets and processed model outputs could be used collaboratively to help advance knowledge beyond their original purpose?  It is these questions that are motivating the movement towards open data, better data management and collaboration and sharing in the use of data and models.  In short, researchers are relying more on teamwork to tackle the big problems of the day.  This seminar will describe research being done developing a system, called HydroShare, to address these questions in the context of water data and models. HydroShare is advancing hydrologic science by enabling the scientific community to more easily and freely share products resulting from their research, not just the scientific publication summarizing a study, but also the data and models used to create the scientific publication.  This capability is necessary for community model development, execution, and evaluation and to improve reproducibility and community trust in scientific findings through transparency. As a platform for collaboration and running models on advanced computational infrastructure, HydroShare enhances the capability for data intensive research in hydrology and other aligned sciences.  This seminar will provide information for you on how you could take advantage of HydroShare in your own work.title is University of Virginia Seminar 11/10/17, "Advancing Hydrology through Collaborative Data and Model Sharing using HydroShare". creator is Tarboton, David. author is Tarboton, David. creator is Tarboton, David. subject is HydroShare Presentation. subject is Seminar. subject is UVA2017. organization is Utah State University. organization is The HydroShare Team. availability is public. format is application/x-netcdf. format is application/zip. format is image/tiff. format is application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. source is http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/86e691cbdfa84f2c905c1a7ecc3e41f9. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Tarboton, David.

 u'There are limited open source data available for determining water production/treatment and required energy for cities across the United States. This database represents the culmination of a two-year effort to obtain data from cities across the United States via open records requests in order to determine the state of the U.S. urban energy-water nexus. Data were requested at the daily or monthly scale when available for 127 cities across the United States, represented by 253 distinct water and sewer districts. Data were requested from cities larger than 100,000 people and from each state. In the case of states that did not have cities that met these criteria, the largest cities in those states were selected. The resulting database represents a drinking water service population of 81.4 million and a wastewater service population of 86.2 million people.  Average daily demands for the United States were calculated to be 560 liters per capita for drinking water and 500 liters per capita of wastewater. The embedded energy within each of these resources is 340 kWh/1000 m3 and 430 kWh/1000 m3, respectively.  Drinking water data at the annual scale are available for production volume (89 cities) and for embedded energy (73 cities). Annual wastewater data are available for treated volume (104 cities) and embedded energy (90 cities). Monthly data are available for drinking water volume and embedded energy (73 and 56 cities) and wastewater volume and embedded energy (88 and 70 cities).

 u'"The Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) is designed to simulate the complete hydrologic processes of dendritic watershed systems. The software includes many traditional hydrologic analysis procedures such as event infiltration, unit hydrographs, and hydrologic routing. HEC-HMS also includes procedures necessary for continuous simulation including evapo-transpiration, snowmelt, and soil moisture accounting. Advanced capabilities are also provided for gridded runoff simulation using the linear quasi-distributed runoff transform (ModClark). Supplemental analysis tools are provided for model optimization, forecasting streamflow, depth-area reduction, assessing model uncertainty, erosion and sediment transport, and water quality.\r\n\r\nThe software features a completely integrated work environment including a database, data entry utilities, computation engine, and results reporting tools. A graphical user interface allows the user seamless movement between the different parts of the software. Simulation results are stored in HEC-DSS (Data Storage System) and can be used in conjunction with other software for studies of water availability, urban drainage, flow forecasting, future urbanization impact, reservoir spillway design, flood damage reduction, floodplain regulation, and systems operation."\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-hms/ (Nov 16, 2017)title is Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS). author is none. subject is model. subject is watershed. subject is surface water hydrology. organization is Hydrologic Engineering Center. availability is private. format is application/x-msdos-program. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Model Program Resource. owner is Goodall, Jonathan.

 u'This resource models outflow at USGS station 01665500 using HEC-HMS software. Precipitation data was imported from the Charlottesville-Albemarle regional airport, which is located about 13 miles northeast of the outflow gage. SCS-curve number, SCS Unit Hydrograph, baseflow recession, and Muskingum routing methods were selected in HEC-HMS. No canopy or surface method was used. The model was calibrated using a precipitation event on 05/05/2016, and tested using an event from 4/19-20/2015. Results show an underestimation of peak outflow of 15% compared to observed data for one model test. The most significant discrepancy between the model and observed outflow is peak flow time, which is likely due in large part to the 13 mile distance between precipitation and outflow gages. Differences may also be due to varying antecedent moisture conditions.

 u'HEC-HMS 4.2.1 can be used to accurately route stream flow through a selected watershed. A model of the Rapidan River Watershed, VA was calibrated using a precipitation event occurring on April 2nd, 2005 at 15:00PM. The baseflow method chosen was the recession method and Muskingum routing was used as a routing method. Optimization trials were used once the model closely resembled the observed precipitation event. Model accuracy was determined by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient and Peak Volume of discharge, before testing the model with additional precipitation events of similar size and seasonal occurrence. Peak discharge volume was unable to match the observed data for additional storms. The model was able to predict the time of peak discharge with accuracy, all three storm peaks reported within 15 minutes of observed data. Since this model was able to accurately predict the time of the peak discharge, it is still possible to use this model for temporal flow routing through the Rapidan River Watershed.

 u'The resource is a HEC-HMS model of a watershed for USGS Station 01665500. The station was used as a gage in ArcGIS to create a watershed. This watershed was then split into three smaller sub-watersheds and this was modeled in HEC-HMS. The original parameters for the watershed were determined using ArcMap. After the HEC-HMS model was created, it was calibrated with a storm event from May 1, 2013. The parameters were changed manually until a Nash-Sutcliffe value of 0.986 was obtained when simulated flows were compared to those observed at the USGS Station. Rainfall and Flow dss files were used for the HEC-HMS model and are included. The original storm used for calibration has the flow and rainfall data in RealDataHW1.dss. The second storm used to determine goodness of fit for the model is named Storm3-6-11.dss. The storm used for calibration had abnormally high discharge values for the amount of rainfall. It had a peak discharge of 13,500 cfs for 3 in. of rainfall while the second storm of similar size (2.7 in.) had a peak flow of only 4430 cfs. After using the HEC-HMS Optimization Tool and optimizing Initial Abstraction ratio, a Nash-Sutcliffe value of 0.992 was obtained for the first storm. The model was then updated with the new initial abstractions and run for the second storm. The Nash-Sutcliffe value dropped to -5.831 showing the model was inaccurate. This inaccuracy is believed to be due to due the model being calibrated for a storm with unusual discharge characteristics.title is HEC-HMS Model for Watershed Feeding USGS 01665500. creator is Bowers, John. author is Bowers, John. creator is Bowers, John. subject is HEC-HMS. subject is USGS Station 01665500. subject is Calibration. organization is University of Virginia. availability is public. format is application/dss. format is application/log. format is application/results. format is application/optim. format is application/run. format is application/met. format is application/basin. format is application/out. format is application/control. format is application/gage. format is application/dsc. format is application/hms. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Bowers, John.

 u'This is a HEC-HMS model for runoff estimation from a 115 sq-mile watershed at Ruckersville, VA and the work was done for Hydrology class project at University of Virginia for Fall 2017. The watershed has 3 subbasins where subbasin 1 and 2 discharge to reach-1 via junction-1, and reach 1 and subbasin-3 discharge to outlet (junction-2). Precipitation from NOAA weather station \u201cPiedmont\u201d at Orange County was used to generate flow from this watershed. Modeled flow was then compared with observed flow at USGS Station \u201cRapidan River near Ruckersville, VA\u201d (Station 01665500) with Latitude 38\xb016\'50" and   Longitude 78\xb020\'25".  For original model, a rain event from May 2013 was used and for validation, two events from Mar 2011 and Oct 2012 were chosen. The original model was calibrated first without adding baseflow to any subbasins and the model simulation after the hydrograph peak wasn\u2019t satisfactory. Then, baseflow was added to subbasin-2 as that creates best match for the modeled flow with the observed one.  This calibration shows nearly perfect goodness of fit with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E) of 0.938. In addition, 2 other rain events from Oct 2012 and May 2013  were used for model validation which produced very weak goodness of fit with negative E. This difference might result in due to weather, soil moisture condition, peak flow etc. Overall, the HEC-HMS model was calibrated perfectly for about 14,000 cfs peak flow in May but the validation result was not satisfactory, so the model needs further verification to become representative for the watershed for a wide range of peak flow and season.title is Estimating runoff at Ruckersville, VA using HEC-HMS, calibrating and validating the model. creator is Md Sabit. author is Md Sabit. creator is Md Sabit. subject is Runoff. subject is HEC-HMS. subject is validation. subject is calibration. availability is public. format is application/zip. identifier is hydroShareIdentifier. language is eng. resource_type is Composite Resource. owner is Md Sabit.
